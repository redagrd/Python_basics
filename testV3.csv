tt5433140;Fast X;BA_Harrison;"Fast & Furious 9 did what a lot of franchises do at some point: it took the action into outer space. This seemed to me like a good point to call it quits. But with the money still rolling in, nobody in Hollywood was going to end this cash cow; thus we have Fast X, the first in a rumoured three part finale (until the inevitable reboot).
I've been on board with the franchise since the start, sticking with it as it moved from the street racing world into more James Bond territory, the action getting more and more ridiculous with each chapter. Seeing how each movie would top the one before in terms of craziness is what kept me entertained. But Fast X is just dumb, and it's not even dumb fun.
The stunts are more preposterous than ever, but the film is never thrilling, every interminable action scene enhanced by rather ropey CGI (the flames, in particular, look really bad). There are some dreadful attempts at humour (mostly courtesy of Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris), and we get all that inevitable crap about the importance of family (if I see the gang having another barbecue I think I'll hurl).
And then there's Jason Momoa as villain Dante...
I can see what they were going for -- kooky flamboyant psycho capable of almost anything -- but Momoa is absolutely awful, his performance bordering on camp, not helped by the character's dubious choice of attire. It's hard to find Dante menacing when he's flouncing about in a silky shirt. I'll no doubt watch the next two films for the sake of completion, but with Momoa on board it'll be hard going.
Fast X is easily the weakest of the series so far, but I'll give it 3/10 because I guess things could get even worse.";3;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0945066/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9065637/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-19
tt5433140;Fast X;ksgillihan;The Fast franchise is a movie series that should have faded away a long, long time ago. It started out as a fun but a bit over the top high-octane thrill ride but has descended into the realm of cartoons. With each iteration the action gets increasingly more and more unbelievable. Everybody likes an action film with chases and escapes and fights but what we get here is something like a bad anime in real life. Sure they tried and tried hard to make this movie more spectacular than all the others but one can only shut off their brain for so long. Pushing the boundaries of cinema is one thing but when you throw all sense and reality out the window you get, well this. In the first 5 minutes of the movie I already could tell this was going straight to the Moon with zero plan of how to actually get there. You see Dominic's 8 year old son driving and drifting a muscle car around a parking lot as if he was a pro. Utter ridiculous crap. What's next, to the actual Moon? Or maybe there is a secret bunker in the center of the Earth the team has to infiltrate in order to save the world? Or maybe Dom's car gets a time machine installed in it and they travel back in time to fight Hitler and the SS? I mean, why not? Everything else that happens in this movie is just as plausible. Everyone in Dom's team is an expert at everything and they all seem to be super-human as well. When will this garbage actually end?;4;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53713622/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9064224/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-19
tt5433140;Fast X;Prismark10;"By this point, I went to see Fast X without a clue as to what happened in the last one. I think some people went to space.
The F&F series is one where villains become friends, people come back from the dead and cars defy the laws of physics. No one has an idea of the story soon after they watched it.
A plot inspired by Fast 5, where they stole a safe and rode it along the streets of Rio de Janeiro.
Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) is the sociopathic son of Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and he wants to make Dom Toretto and his family suffer for what happened to his dad.
The main action starts by dropping a big rolling bomb in Rome and aim it for the Vatican.
Plagued with behind the scenes issues. Original director Justin Lin departed soon after shooting started. Director Louis Leterrier does a workmanlike job. As he showed in the Netflix series Lupin, Now You See Me as well as The Transporter movies. He can do car stunts as well as sleight of hand. Some of the CGI looked cheap though.
As for Momoa, the director obviously told him. Man you will never play the Joker, too Polynesian. So Dante is your Joker and dial it up to 12. He is loud, camp and is having a ball. Especially with those two IT guys with a funny grin on their faces.
Some of the regulars are even more tiresome. A few should had showed up but did not like those two Brazilian guys from the earlier movies. John Cena plays lovable Uncle Jacob, he was the main villain in the last one.
The movie actually has four Oscar winning actresses. Not one of them told Vin Diesel how to do dramatic. When Dom had these small tender scenes, I nearly fell asleep.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4569900/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9093820/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-01
tt5433140;Fast X;hectordanielbuelna;"Fast X finally went too far.
As far as I remember, people keep complaining about this movies being dumb, however, people often dismisses the the charm of the action and the overcomplicated plots of crazy writers trying to show how smart they are. This time they actually went too far.
Once again they retcon an old movie by adding scenes that weren't there. Once again they got caught on a ""revenge plot"" and once again family has to come together to defeat evil. They quite literallu rehashed the plot of the last 2-3 movies, but this time they got lazy!
The whole family is vack qith a brand new cast.
Allan Ritchson, I love the guy, but he can't act to save his life. He has the funniest dialogues in the entire movie, though.
Alison Brie, the second worse actor in the entire movie, has absolutely no chemistry with the entire cast. It's actually impressive, she seem uncomfortable in every scene. I don't get it.
John Cena again charming his way into making you like his character, he can't act either, but he actually takes advantage of the dialogues and his own phisicality to sell the Jacob Toretto.
And Jason Momoa... Just played a goofier Joker. Jared Leto would be proud. He's even obsessed with the color purple. Someone must've felt very cheeky when he said something on the lines of ""I don't wanna kill them, I just want to hurt them real bad"". What a failure of a villain. Jumping back and forwards between a serious villain and an clown.
This was, overall, a very dull, uninteresting and boring disappointment. Fast 9 shoulda been the last one.
Not looking forward to the sequels to this mess, not at all.";3;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur131708142/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9063885/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-19
tt5433140;Fast X;towe-51620;I have to admit all you people who forewarned me still didn't prepare me for the absolute most ridiculous movie in this franchise & definitely in the top 20 of worst movies ever! Everything was forced, the acting was stale and wooden, nobody seemed to care that they were looking like what they were out there doing! Stroking Vin's ego and not caring how they came across. They were all just going through the motions of a movie with less plot the Wiley Coyote and the Roadrunner. Momoa did a cheap imitation of Ledgers Joker and every part of this movie was just one lifted from 1 or more of the previous 9 movies! The car in outer Space was 10 times better than this 10 year olds version of the Fast & Furious. Fast is just a blatant rip off of Point Break. Walker was Keanu as Johnny Utah, Vin as Swayze's Bohdi. Instead of surfing it's cars and in some they actually rob a bank or two. This movie should never have been made as it contains nothing of what made this group of films popular as they are. The next one hopefully will be the last forever! Whoever gave this more than a 1 has to be somebody related to someone in the movie or a 5 year old! This was so bad that it wasn't even funny and the torment lasted almost 3 hours of non stop chaos and pointless plots with going back and forth between too many storylines that were not connected or understandable! If you don't want to waste 3 hours of your life, skip this and watch Looney Tunes, they are superior in every way!;1;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur63355756/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9078604/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-26
tt5433140;Fast X;chevolek;"This should have been titled ""Fast X: Hot Wheels´ Ludricous Movie""
Every 2 minutes I was like ""Are you serious??!!""
Last time they went to space in a ludricuous speed and with no NASA training. Really??! What is next? Going to the dark side of the moon and fight Transformers side by side with Marvel or DC characters?
This is a franchise where the bad guys turn good guys in the next sequel, and were characters come back from the dead.
The Jason Momoa character is ridiculous. I mean, a joke every now and then it´s fine but he should have been a scary character not a cartoonish one laughing every time he did something bad. And he had an incredible eye sight to watch al the action miles away eve though there were buildings between he and the cars racing miles away, maybe he was usig his Aquaman super eye sight.
This is the franchise that went from real street racing (2001) with no guns, to immortal characters and indestructible vehices with super human stunts and gravity-defying people and vehicles where the characters have become experts in fighting and experts in the use of military grade weapons and experts in weaponry made for word war 3 using them with incredible precision and experts in technology. The scenes have become more ridiculous in every new sequel.
The best Fast & Furious movies were definitely the first trilogy. Some of the sequels were okay. The late Paul Walker, even though he wasn´t a great actor (Vin Diesel definitely is not a good actor), he provided great moments to them. Vin Diesel is always with his exaggerated mad face with his face inclined down facing forward. Now it´s all about $$$$ not about making good movies.
In past FF movies, Vin´s Toretto has been saying the line: ""One last ride"". Well, as log as cash is flowing, the sequels will be coming, no matter how ridiculous they are.
Instead of this movie, I would definitely recommend you to watch the FF spoof: ""Superfast!"" (2015). It is way beter than this.";1;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur79187216/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9077620/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-25
tt5433140;Fast X;schorschi100;"I am (was) a huge fan of the ""fast and the furious"" series, and of Vin Diesel. Although I am a physicist I can live with ""curbing"" the laws of nature to some extent, provided that this is justified (e.g., through SciFi, magic, alternate universes etc.). It is also OK in movies like Mission Impossible and similar to drive things to the extreme. However, when both physics AND logic go awry it's simply too much.
The main villain in the story, (Dante, played by an amazing Jason Mamoa) is simply a joke. He is super intelligent, super rich, super powerful, and a caricature of a sociopath à la Joker. He is able to organize his crimes (which are purely driven by hatred) in such perfect timing across the globe and with access to every possible computer, that his abilities surpass those of Robert Langdon's foes (DaVince code), of Thanos (Avengers) and all James Bonds enemies at once. It borders ridicule. And, the most importantly, makes the film boring.
In the next episode they are going probably to have spaceships racing across the galaxy I guess, and Dante will use nuclear fusion to kill.
Acting is generally from decent to very good (well it's not Shakespeare after all, so not utterly important), and the cinematography (referring to the effects) excellent. Unfortunately a nice packaging does not salvage a really bad content.
Finally, I really abhor cliffhangers, and I seldom (if ever) have seen such an infuriating one. It's one thing to leave things open in a story, and quite a different one to literally stop the action in the middle of the most intense scene, like someone just pulled the plug of the TV. This practically means the producers where so sure the viewer will not watch the next one, that they had to use every means to animate them to do so. Plain awful and tasteless.
In a whole this is by far the worst of an otherwise very good series. If you really want to watch it, at least wait until the next one comes out to save yourself the frustration of the unfinished scene.";2;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6604048/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9107598/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-08
tt5433140;Fast X;ItsRobinTV;"I don't know what I expected from this movie. It's a total mess. But let's try to stay positive and start with a good point.
The opening is probably the best part of the movie so make sure you enjoy it. Additionally, all the scenes with Jacob were surprisingly good and funny where on the other hand the scenes with Roman and Tej aren't that funny anymore. Also you need to stay till the Post credit scene. I would say it's worth the wait.
But enough good things. The story is very bad. Normally, the action compensates the bad story but this is not the case here because the action is also one of the worst we have seen in a Fast & Furious movie yet combined with even worse VFX. Furthermore, the cars should be a very important aspect of the movie but no, not in this one. The cars play a pretty small part and are just there so they can call it a Fast & Furious movie. Also the movie is too long. We only see bad action after bad action and then learn about how a new character is related to this whole family, just boring.
And the most important question: Are the scenes realistic? Not really but after we have seen a car in Space the scenes are relatively realistic.
With this movie Universal just wanted to make money but completely forgets about us fans. After we watched it we are forced to watch the next one and spend even more money which is just too bad.

tt5433140;Fast X;A_Different_Drummer;"The late media guru Marshall McLuhan offered the world an interesting meme, called Media Ecology, which finally acknowledged the resources used in media as precious and drew attention to their waste. Nobody else had ever noticed this. (Much like in our current upside-down age nobody notices the rare earth resources needed to make electric cars the standard). In terms of media ecology, this may be the most wasteful movie produced in decades. The actors, the props, the stunts, all devoted to shutting down a franchise that blew a tire years ago and never got it patched. The sheer incompetence of this script is clear from the character that Momoa tries so hard to breathe life into ... and fails. By the time the Big FInale rolls down the highway, at the 2:00:00 mark, the poor viewer is no longer rooting for the Good Guys or the Bad Guys.

tt5433140;Fast X;abisio;"Original Fast and the Furious was copy of Point Break (a not very successful masterpiece that later become a cult classic) exchanging surf boards by cars. It worked and guarantee a sequel but Diesel was not interested so it was replaced by Tyrese Gibson. The movie was highly successful but produces decide to do a cheap one in Tokyo; that end up with a Diesel cameo granting the fourth installment.
The fourth part had the original protagonists and made some money; so after a while Diesel become one of the producers and with the higher budget and few spectacular scenes became an absolute blockbuster.
That luck lasted for the next four movies; keeping mostly the same cast (minus some dead that came back to life) and strongly villains and spectacular almost realistic scenes.
Weil it is not the case here. The only good thing is Momoa doing the bad guy and having fun; and John Cena doing some kind of sympathetic monster.
The rest of the cast; as good as usually is; has very little to do; and has little interaction with Diesel.
Diesel itself is a complete disaster. He barely act and is basically Superman; it was a thief originally but now became a generous loving person who only cares about his family and friends.
Louis Leterrier and usually good action movie director used to lower budget movies; does not seems confortable with this one.
The special effects are very poor; that last sequences is really lame and very cheap made and the movie is overload with fight sequences and very little cars ones. In fact the most spectaculars are the ones showed from FF 5 a few times during this movie.
To make matters worse; the script is absurd; overly long (141 minutes) and the movie has no ending; leaving open for X2 or XI

Racing Victors, Racing Heat, Racing Rivals, Racing Independence, Racing Mavericks, Racing Tranquility, Racing Liberty, Racing Bliss, Racing Winners, Racing Explorer, Racing Heaven... and many, many more - and those are just the titles starting with Racing, there are other obvious patterns with different title words.
This has to be a world record for bogus ChatGPT reviews. I mean it's pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low, and they're that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way. It also proves how little faith they have in their own film. The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54% rating is a more accurate. I gave it a generous 6/10.
It's too bad more effort didn't go into the writing and S/VFX (which needed major toning down and lacked realism), as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise. This was too long, too slow, and too cartoonish. The writing was infantile, like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens, and Momoa's character was too overboard and can't be taken in long doses. They basically tried to copy The Joker's character instead of creating his own persona. His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining. Don't even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X. They should've just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even number.

Well I think that's how Fast X was written. It's a mish-mash of the previous 9 films rolled into one with cameo appearances from almost anyone who's ever starred in any of them. The problem is the story is nonsensical - we have jumps to shoots all around the world for no reason at all. We have a few maudlin scenes from the past. And of course (this is not a spoiler as it's now everywhere in the press) Fast X is not in fact the last film of the franchise so there is no closure of any sort at the end. The cast felt tired, going through the motions. I think even they think there's maybe been too many movies in this franchise. The only saving grace here was the wonderfully over the top villain played brilliantly by Jason Momoa - every scene he was in stood out.
Yes there's the usual over the top stunts (though personally I thought not as good as some of the previous films) racing for no real point, fight scences etc so the fans of the franchise will probably enjoy it.

At this point, I don't know if spoilers for certain aspects of this film would in fact be spoilers or be considered a PSA, but I digress. I get ahead of myself. Let's start from the beginning
Momma always taught me not to write angry. My local AMC being a scant 2 miles from my apartment, I decided it was as good a time as any to heed that axiom. Perhaps the brisk walk home would calm me down. Settle my nerves. Perhaps I could even devise a less profanity-laden diatribe of how awful this film was and approach it in a state of zen.
The walk worked a tad but when I started writing I could feel the seeth start anew. The endless cliched dialog recycled from countless other films, the stale humor way past its expiration date, the ok action sequences that were better done in previous Fast and furious films. The Ending... all of these intertwined to leave a rancid taste in my mouth.
Even the parts of the film that worked (Jason Momoa makes for a reasonably fun villain, Statham is always a joy to watch doing his thing) are fleeting, in the later's case his part is much to small, in the former the long bloated runtime dillutes his appeal somewhat
Is it an all together AWFUL film? Nope not really. It is what it is. Is it a vast disappointing outing for the series? YES

tt5433140;Fast X;arabnikita;"Fast X (2023)
The Fast and Furious franchise has become the topic of endless jokes whether it's the nonsensical plots, Bollywood rivalling action or the obsession with FaMiLy. While they did have their moments, after part 5, the reason why I watched these films was to roast the stupidity with my friends and hopefully to get some enjoyment out of it. Everytime I wondered what science defying spectacle they were going to shock me with but sadly this time, everything was rather normal by the standards of the franchise.
In Fast X, the family of racers turned secret agents goes up against a new omnipotent villain named Dante who is a hybrid of Mugatu From Zoolander, Tom Hardy's Charles Bronson and Jared Leto's Joker. Dante is on a mission to make Dom suffer but over the course of the movie, it's the audience who ends up suffering the most. Unlike the predecessors, there weren't any cool elements, enjoyable fight sequences or laughable moments to make the experience worth suffering through. Considering that cars are a superpower of the franchise, there weren't enough car related sequences either.
Even though there is an action sequence with blasting music every 5 minutes, I actually felt bored most of the time. On one side it's the general cacophony of the events and poor VFX while on the other, it's the lack of this logic defying craziness that I have come to expect. When I wasn't bored, I was cringing from the dialogue and painful head splitting humor. Oh, and when did John Cena go from a cold blooded murderer to a fun loving uncle?
Fast X is a pure set up for the sequels as the story dashes between geographical locations while shoving too many characters and giving some of them around 3 minutes of screen time. I have obliterated the past 4 movies in my reviews but I have never been bored while watching them. It's neitehr grounded like the first four movies nor is it over-the-top like the next five. Better than Fast Nine but still hazardous to the human brain.

tt5433140;Fast X;Braga_HK;"Does it live up to the hype?
Unfortunately, the answer is no. Fast X is a disappointing and nonsensical mess that fails to entertain or impress. The plot is thin and convoluted, the characters are bland and forgettable, and the logic is nonexistent. The film relies on cheap CGI, unrealistic physics, and ridiculous coincidences to create its spectacle, but it only succeeds in creating eye-rolling moments and disbelief.
The film's biggest flaw is its lack of realism and consistency. The film expects us to believe that Dominic Toretto and his team can survive anything, from driving down stairs, to jumping out of planes, to falling off dams, without a scratch. They can also outrun and outsmart the police, the military, and a global terrorist organization with ease. They can hack into any system, use any weapon, and drive any vehicle with no training or preparation. They can also defy the laws of nature, such as gravity, momentum, and thermodynamics, with their cars and gadgets.
The film also expects us to care about the characters and their relationships, but it fails to develop them or give them any depth. The film introduces characters, such as Jakob Toretto (Dominic's long-lost brother) and Gisele (a former ally who was presumed dead), but they are poorly written and acted. The film also brings back characters, such as Cipher (the main villain from the previous film) and Letty (Dominic's wife), but they are reduced to clichés and stereotypes. The film tries to create drama and tension between them, but it feels forced and artificial.
The film also tries to be funny and witty, but it falls flat. The film's humor relies on lame jokes, awkward banter, and childish insults that are not funny or clever. The film also tries to be cool and badass, but it comes off as cheesy and cringy. The film's soundtrack is generic and forgettable, the dialogue is corny and predictable, and the action scenes are over-the-top and boring.
Fast X is a waste of time and money. It is a poorly made film that insults the intelligence and taste of its audience. It is a film that should be avoided by anyone who values quality cinema or entertainment. It is a film that deserves a rating of 1 out of 10 stars.";1;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44921297/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9110397/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-09
tt5433140;Fast X;jtindahouse;"Admittedly I hadn't seen of these 'Fast' movies in a long time, but I'm not crazy am I - the cast wasn't always this strong, was it? There is a truly insane lineup of stars in this movie, and somehow the movie finds a way to give every one of them a purpose.
Jason Momoa as the bad guy is worth mentioning as being terrific. He looked like he had a lot of fun with the role. It seemed like he was given a lot of leeway to do as he pleased and he used it wisely. He actually gave me a lot of 'Joker' vibes.
The film is long at 2 hours and 21 minutes, but it's a rare time when I felt the film could absolutely justify it. For one thing the pacing is incredible and time really does fly by. For another thing there is so much going on and so many cast members who need time to do their thing that it was absolutely necessary. Actually the fact they were able to cut the run time down to only this was an accomplishment.
The action scenes and the story are as outrageous as we have come to expect from this series. It's at the point now where you simply have to sit back, switch your mind off and enjoy the ride. And to be honest it's pretty easy to do with this film. I had a great time. 8/10.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3793011/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9060638/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-17
tt5433140;Fast X;steveinadelaide;"I buckled up for the latest instalment in the adrenaline-fueled franchise, Fast X. Having previously enjoyed the well-made escapist nonsense of this franchise, I eagerly anticipated this action-packed joyride. But the reality falls short of the high-octane thrills and heart-racing moments we've enjoyed during this long-running, beloved series. Directed by a new visionary, Fast X struggles to find its footing, leaving me with a disjointed and lacklustre experience.
Though intended to be the cornerstone of the film, the plot feels convoluted and overstuffed. The narrative attempts to tie up loose ends from previous entries, resulting in a tangled web of unresolved storylines and contrived twists. The themes of loyalty, family, and redemption, which once resonated deeply, are now lost amidst the chaos of overblown action sequences and cheesy dialogue.
Unfortunately, the once-charismatic characters we've grown to love seem to be mere shadows of their former selves. The lacklustre performances by the ensemble cast dampen the film's impact, leaving me yearning for the chemistry and charisma that once made this franchise shine. The newcomers fail to make a lasting impression, and their interactions feel forced, lacking the organic camaraderie we expect from a Fast and Furious film.
While attempting to inject fresh energy into the series, the direction falters in execution. The pacing is erratic, with frenetic action scenes abruptly juxtaposed with moments of forced sentimentality. The director's attempts to reinvent the franchise fall flat, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying experience.
The score, cinematography, and production design, once standout elements of the Fast and Furious films, fail to leave a lasting impact. The familiar pulsating beats and slick visuals that defined the series are noticeably absent, replaced by generic choices that fail to elevate the overall experience. The special effects, too, lack the finesse and attention to detail we've come to expect, leaving action scenes feeling artificial and detached.
The editing further exacerbates the film's issues with jarring cuts and questionable transitions. Scenes that should have heightened the tension instead fall flat, as the editing fails to maintain a cohesive flow. The dialogue, filled with clichés and uninspired one-liners, adds little depth to the already weak characterisations, leaving me longing for the witty banter and memorable lines that once made these films a guilty pleasure.
While Fast X attempts to recapture the essence of what made this franchise a global phenomenon, it falls short in almost every aspect. As a viewer, I felt a palpable sense of disappointment, longing for the days when these films delivered heart-pounding action and captivating storytelling. It pains me to say that Fast X fails to leave a lasting impact, leaving me questioning the franchise's future.
Fast X is a lacklustre entry in the series, struggling to find its place amidst a convoluted plot, underwhelming performances, and a misguided attempt at reinvention. Despite its best intentions, the film fails to deliver the thrills and emotional resonance that made its predecessors successful. Fast X is a forgettable and disjointed experience that falls far behind the high standards set by the franchise-strap in for a disappointing ride.";3;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25255776/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9083044/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-28
tt5433140;Fast X;chris_rowe-881-168820;"This film felt just about Vin Diesel telling the world how great he is, telling himself he's the best and that this franchise hasn't been irrelevant for atleast 5 years. The self grandeur and narcissism by a guy who is running a franchise into the ground and making it more of a joke out of a legitimate fear now guardians is done, he won't get any big roles.
Rightly so, let's say the truth, the guy cannot act, there were so many close ups of his face looking for reaction/emotion, there was none, you could've switched it for a baked potato with googly eyes and gotten more. His voice is almost grating, it's so mumbling and slow, plus the dialogue, this film must set a world record for the use of ""family"". It's legitimately cringe and the reasoning is because they cannot justify keep making these films.
The only other 2 I'm not a huge fan of in this are Natalie and Terese, I like Natalie but she just doesn't click with these characters and her delivery isn't the best, her line ""oh I know stuff now"" was just ridiculous, she's talented but not right and hasn't really fit in since she came in. The last acting one was Tyrese, it's interesting the two that fell out with Rock, the second desperately tried to be comic relief and failed, completely terrible at portray the fun guy of the group. The rest were average to good. Always great to see Jason.
JM was brilliant and only reason this was a 4 and not a 2, he was silly, fun and enjoyable and kind of saved this movie by playing into the stupidity whilst Vin tries to be serious. Can we also acknowledge that Vin diesel although in good shape hasn't got a top tier physique, so there's no need to purposefully hold his arms wide like a silverback looking for territory, especially when atleast 2 on the film make you look skinny. Again vanity.
The action is fine, there's a difference between entertaining and good, the stuff is fun to watch but when it gets too ludicrous it just becomes a bit boring, especially when it's one guy mainly doing the ridiculous. The story was ok, how they did the start was very good though, kinda down hill from there, the tie ins were clever to.
Won't spoil anything, I went into this thinking it was the last one and the ending I was like ""huh"" to then find out 1 but potentially 2 more parts are coming is absolutely stupid. 3 films to wrap up this? If anyone thinks it's anything other than Bin desperately trying to keep it alive so his rotten ability doesn't end his career is deluded. That's why every issue, he's involved, if he legitimately thought this was good, it's embarrassing. His performance ruined it, if there was less of him and more of the others then yeah this could actually be fun! It's being kept on life support by a narcissist and means the franchise will end as a joke which people want to die instead of what it could've been or what it was when it started. I knew when PW died that when it didn't end because of that, the only way it ends is when Vin says! Let this sink in 2027 will likely be the third, he will be 60!

This reviewer simply hated the overly melodramatic and complicated family tree story with big muscles, big cars, big muscle cars, big crucifixes, big rev's, big baddies, big guns and Little B.
Apart from an inventive (but gravity-defying) escape in the elevator, this supposedly ""grounded in reality"" (not my words) action ""superhero"" movie is unrealistically cliché, corny, poorly scripted and overused; and when I thought I had seen it all (cars exploding and jumping 10 feet in the air, an agency TV room with screens 360 degrees all over the place, a submarine bomb on fire): Dame Helen Mirren pops out of nowhere!

tt5433140;Fast X;Dannyboi94;"Ever since the Fast Five (in my opinion the best movie in the series), The Fast Franchise has taken a nosedive. It is now straight up ridiculous what this series has turned into. A street gang, is basically an army of unstoppable and invinsible soldiers. Seriously these people would probably survive a nucular blast - or a more likely scenario, Dom Tortetto would likely absorb the blast and shoot it from his eyeballs. It's gotten that absurd.
While this movie is close to being an MCU movie, it is drastically better than the horrific previous movie, which made me rethink what a movie is. Fast X is pretty good for the most part, if you can switch off your brain and not take anything you see seriously at all.
The story is as you would expect - bad, but it flows from point A to B which is good enough. The visual effects are great, the soundtrack is pretty good as well. But the clear standout here is Jason Momoa. His acting and character is a blast to watch. Every scene he's in, keeps your attention, because he brings a much needed fun and humorous vibe to this weird movie. Jason was clearly having fun here, because it translates to the screen. His crazy character was more compelling than most, if not all of the previous villains of the series combined. So the reason I am even giving this movie a 6, is solely because of Jason as Dante.
Fast X ends of a stupid cliffhanger, but if we get to see more of Dante, I'm up for the next installment. Let's just hope thye don't stick to this trend of making villains heroes by the end, and killing off more people only to bring them back a few years later.";6;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65076361/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9113656/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-11
tt10366206;John Wick: Chapter 4;neil-476;"The Table, the international crminal brotherhood which has condemned John Wick empowers The Marquis to deal with him (and the Manager of the New York Continentale Hotel). But maybe, just maybe, there is a way out.
As expected, the IMDB is full of people saluting this as ""Best John Wick yet,"" ""A masterpiece,"" ""Best action movie ever,"" etc. My view differs. But I must start by giving credit where it is due. Production design, cinematography, action choreography and direction are all first rate, and they deserved a much better film that this is. And this film deserved a much better script than this.
The story is fine, quite good even, but it is buried under industrial quantities of action which defies belief. Everbody's resistance to trauma and the complete absence of police are just the big two, but let's not forget the endless succession of pairs of heavies coming out of nowhere and only stopping when Wick has no gun.
And even the scriot deserved a better actor than Keanu Reeves. To be fair, the character in the first film has been reduced to a mere cardboard cutout here, but Reeves (who I genuinely like as a performer) doesn't even play cardboard well here.
This is beautifully crafted drivel. 7 for craft, 3 for Reeves' central performance, averages to 5.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7813355/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8960544/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-03-30
tt10366206;John Wick: Chapter 4;siderite;"Imagine a video game where you are shooting bad guys. Your hardware is old so everything is kind of slow and out of focus. The opponents are set to Easy and you installed a hack to give you invincibility and autoaim. And they come at you slowly, shouting, out in the open, with weapons that fire three or four bullets before they run out and they can shoot anything anyway. They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife. And you try to fight them in a decent manner, yet your avatar moves like a 60 year old man and even with the autoaim you still suck. And if you somehow get into the many separate levels where nothing make sense, you get a big cinematic that takes you out of it. And because the cinematic is in 4k or whatever, it feels like slow motion.
That, my friends, is the experience of watching JW4. The style that people have applauded in the first movie has turned into a demented caricature, the fight scenes are ridiculously bad, the actions of the characters make no sense at all, the world described makes no sense. Not even the tongue-in-cheek references to The Matrix don't hit, because you know that if you enjoyed that film, you're now over 40 and it makes you feel old. The film is three hours of irrelevance.
And if you are among the people who I can't understand that rated this film anything above boring, just watch the end credits scene. It destroys the little joy that you might have kept watching this.
Bottom line: So many talented people worked on this film. With them on board, I cannot imagine a worse outcome. It's not even funny, it's just sad.";4;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3146136/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9073117/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-23
tt10366206;John Wick: Chapter 4;BA_Harrison;"The first three John Wick films came in fairly quick succession, with only five years between the first and third chapters, each film trying to top the one before in terms of wild set pieces. For me, it all became a bit too much, the action rapidly becoming too frenetic and over-the-top. By Parabellum (part three), I had had enough.
I hoped that the four years between Parabellum and this fourth entry in the franchise had given me a big enough breather that I might be able to find new appreciation for the excessive mayhem. If anything, I found Chapter 4 even more tiresome: the fight scenes, as technically excellent as they are, simply don't know when to quit, and they're even more ridiculous than ever. Wick has been established as a semi-mythical being (Baba Yaga), seemingly impervious to pain and injury, meaning that the character is never in any real peril, which generates zero jeopardy or excitement. If anything, the relentless action scenes result in boredom, being mind-numbingly repetitive and far-fetched (the whopping 2 hours 49 minutes runtime doesn't help).
Director Chad Stahelski pushes plausibility way beyond breaking point with a protracted melee amidst the traffic around the Arc De Triomphe that somehow fails to attract the attention of the Paris gendarmerie; an even more dumb scene (in a film packed with dumb scenes) sees nightclub revellers continuing to dance while people are being shot and axed to death all around them. The final act - a duel between John and blind warrior Caine (Donnie Yen) - takes place outside the Basilica of Sacré-Coeur de Montmartre at dawn, with not a single tourist or passerby to alert the authorities of what is occurring.
I've been known to enjoy comic-book action films that aren't exactly grounded in reality, but John Wick 4 seems to take place in an alternate universe where none of our rules apply. Since very little of what we see in this film can be believed, I definitely don't swallow the idea that John Wick is actually dead at the end (although I sincerely hope he is).
Those claiming that this is the best action film ever made have clearly never seen The Raid 2 (or any early John Woo film, or The Night Comes For Us, or Ong-Bak, or Born To Fight, or Eastern Condors or In The Line of Duty IV or.... well, you get the idea).";4;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0945066/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8950606/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-03-25

There is something entertaining about dumb nonsense sometimes, and the first two of this franchise was decently okay in this regard. The last one and this one however not so much, only dumb.
This movie is almost 3 hours long, and oh boy do you feel every minute. Because if you have seen the previous instalments you have seen this one to. This is like a bad video game repeating the same thing, the same course, the same enemies, and for the 4th time. There is also a post credit scene, which is simply dumb, no reason to stil around for it.
The acting is also horrid, and if you are going to buy any of this you have to have good acting but no.
The only positive I can say about this movie is that it is not as putrified as many other movies lately so for a contemporary action movie this is not as bad as much else.

I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous, the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated. However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. ""Parabellum"" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.";4;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62460576/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8948738/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-03-24

tt10366206;John Wick: Chapter 4;IMDbKeepsDeletingMyReviews;"In this fourth installment of 8711's successful franchise, Keanu Reeves wearily drags himself from setpiece to setpiece, saying little, surviving the most ridiculous setups and finally achieves nothing.
The acting and writing of JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 are indeed the worst aspects of this film, and the exaggerated runtime of almost three hours doesn't help.
Try to remember John Wick's motivation to do all the things he does. What exactly is he actually doing, escpecially in this one? In addition to a lack of motivation, Chapter 4 is a remarkable retcon in the sense that John Wick could have ended the hunt for his person way earlier, thus making at least the last two installments redundant.
There's plenty of action here, sure, but it has been getting more and more unrealistic, and so you'll be in a situation where your suspension of disbelief says bye-bye, especially when you contrast the growing ridiculousness of the action with John Wick's decreasing vigour.
The plot has some toddler level plot holes and contrivances which are really distracting, yes, even in an action no-brainer like this. Keanu Reeves has maybe ten lines of dialogue in the whole movie. The Marquis is a nonsense character, just like Donnie Yen's Caine character. They just appear, but especially in Caine's case you're supposed to be emotional about it because he's basically John Wick's brother from another mother. We just never knew about him. Oh well.
This is the definition of a dumb movie for dumb people, and if you just want to enjoy some nice shots and over-the-top action (some of which is really nice) AND love Keanu Reeves, this is your jam.

tt10366206;John Wick: Chapter 4;FeastMode;"Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.
I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.
There is every kind of fighting imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol/sword combo is my fave).
The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.
There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.
Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.
About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.
The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic.
Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME.
EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.
It's definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road). Every other action movie should learn from this. Updating rating from 8 to 9 stars.

Why would the table head get Caine to kill Wick when he knows he won't. You can challenge the head to a duel as a rule, but they only assigned a head for the first time ever in this movie? WTF? And then the head can select a replacement? And he selects a blind man. All Wick had to do was to stand on the side or drop down and he wouldn't get shot. I think everyone knew Wick didn't shoot in the last round, except for the stupid head bad guy.

Just as the body count in the 3rd was ridiculous, this is even more absurd. Seems after coming up with the bullet proof suit the writers etc thought it a good idea to make sure everyone has one. These giant men sent to kill Wick all wearing suits, raising the jacket to protect their heads was a sight I found so funny. He's the best hitman on the world, how do we kill him? I know, we'll send a blind man!! Pathetic. And he can dodge bullets and he knows where everyone is. You could say it looked choreographed.

tt10366206;John Wick: Chapter 4;cadillac20;"Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.
John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But, of course, this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet.
Covering four continents, we get fights on a massive set of stairs, fights in the middle of traffic, at one of the coolest looking hotels ever shown on screen, and so on. The fighting, of course, is exceptional, and it brings nunchakus, dogs, throwing stars, swords, guns, and so much more. It's everything a John Wick fan could want and, because these films are so technically proficient, you never feel like you're missing any of the action. Possibly the most creative choice is my favorite scene, one that combines a visually fantastic weapon with a shot choice that is unusual for action films of this nature, but the combination of these two pushes the scene into maybe one of action film's greatest scenes.
Admittedly, the story does leave a bit to be desired, but the minor complaints about these kinds of things pale in comparison to what we get. Hollywood has a new film to hold itself to and I have a feeling that (at least for me) action filmmaking will be judged by the standard this movie sets. It's such a blast, I already want to see it again.";10;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2619078/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8935367/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-03-17
tt10366206;John Wick: Chapter 4;tresm87;"Stuntman turned writer/director Chad Stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit John Wick. It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.
One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.
Speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Stahelski/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.
The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.
Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.";9;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur11839633/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8932278/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-03-16

The screenplay was so pretentious and pointless, the dialog looked forced and boring, katana swords vs. Bullets, and almost every bullet could be fenced off by the katana sword blades. The scenarios and the plots just kept stacked up without any reason or clue, just kill, kill, kill...nothing but kills. All the fighting sequences just like Shaw Brothers' 1970s poor and laughable Hong Kong martial art movies, heavily choreographically staged, looked so forced and fake. Every kill was not killed with one bullets but many, yet the handguns seemed equipped with endless bullets, bang, bang, bang, even the fallen guys already dead, but still needed to be shot several times more to increase the violent sound effect. I don't know what's the purpose of making these 4th Chapter, and I think the 1st Chapter only needed a following 2nd Chapter to end it, but what the heck, brainless young viewers need bloody fights, more dead bodies, ridiculous screenplay with clueless storyline, no real plots or real story really needed, just created something like violent video games.

tt10366206;John Wick: Chapter 4;tkdlifemagazine;"John Wick: Chapter 4 picks up where Chapter 3: Parabellum left off. As has been the tradition in the sequels to this beloved martial arts action franchise the action starts from the very inception of the film's opening, and lasts until the curtain falls. JW4 is no exception to that rule. What it does do is improve on the prior installment, and solidify Keanu Reeves as the greatest martial arts action star of all time. If you don't accept that notion, then you must accept the fact that it solidifies Reeves and Director, Chad Stahelski, as the greatest martial arts action pairing of modern times.
The film opens in New York City, the home of the notorious Continental Hotel, and takes us to Osaka Japan, Paris France, and Berlin Germany. Each of those cities plays a major role in Reeves' quest to seek revenge against the High Table for the acts outlined in the prior films, and to seek his unconditional freedom from service to their order.
As the story unfolds we learn a bit more about Wick's past and upbringing than we did in the prior films, but not enough to get bogged down in. He uses his connections to his past, and the help of some old friends to find a path to level the playing field with the High Table's Emissary, The Marquis, played masterfully by Bill Skarsgård. Skarsgård makes the character memorable, and unique, with just a hint of Santino from the second installment.
Keanu Reeves as John Wick in John Wick 4. Photo Credit: Murray Close Hiroyuki Sanada and Reeves are reunited, having starred in 47 Ronin together. Sanada, as is always the case, is a strong presence in the film and makes the most of every scene he is in. He is a great addition to the film. The Osaka Continental fight scenes are groundbreaking, and among the best and most exciting in the entire series. This is some of the best fight and action choreography you will see; only topped by other scenes in this same movie.
Scott Adkins plays an unusually larger than life villain adeptly. The action and violence around the Berlin scenes involving his character, and his relationship to Reeves' past is fun to watch. Adkins is great to watch, whether starring in his own projects, or supporting, as he is here.
Shamier Anderson and Clancy Brown are new to the series and add great value. Anderson as a cunning assassin conflicted between admiration and greed. Clancy Brown is a strong presence and welcome replacement in the role of Adjudicator. I found Asia Kate Dillon's version of the same character to be the weakest part of the prior film, and, perhaps, of the whole series.
Mark Zaror, another great martial artist also has a prominent role as The Marquis' right hand man.
Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne return and offer more than just familiarity to the cast. Their roles are significant and meaningful.
Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.
Keanu Reeves continues to be engaging, empathetic, and dynamic in the role of John Wick. While the series has strayed a bit from the deeply reluctant anti-hero of the first film; we continue to cheer for the good guy caught up in a bad, bad world. One of the great strengths of the film is that Reeves and Stahelski are not afraid the let characters other than Wick shine. In fact, all of the stars of this one have their deeply profound and memorable moments in and out of the company of the main character. This really works.
As for the fight and action choreography. The stunt team at 87eleven continue to elevate the game. The film has three major, larger than life action sequences, that each, individually, outdo anything you will see in any other non John Wick movie. As mentioned previously, the Osaka and Berlin scenes were high energy, high body count affairs. They were complete with gun fights, sword mastery, gun play, and one of the best nunchuck displays you will ever see outside of a Bruce Lee movie. As for the scenes in Paris, at the Arc De Tripomphe, and on the Church steps, they are unlikely to be forgotten and, unlikely, to be topped for years to come, if ever. They are unique and exciting and violent feasts for the eyes.
While I have heard some say that John Wick: Chapter 4 is the best installment in the series I have to disagree, Nothing can top the original, in my opinion; however, Chapter 4 is a worthy installment for sure.
Will there be a Chapter 5 to the JohnWick saga? Remember, I said this was a Spoiler free review....

tt10366206;John Wick: Chapter 4;vengeance20;"Ok, so I got back from seeing this entry yesterday night. I'm writing this review in the early hours after midnight as the film went on for a good whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes!! But we'll get to that in a bit...! Anyway, I was looking forward to this film since John Wick 3's release back in 2019 & this film has had a bit of a troubled history of getting pushed back until it finally got its March 2023 release. I must admit I was a bit skeptical, but, was looking forward to this as the John Wick films are ace, but this film was a bitter disappointment...!
The film sees John Wick, who from the events of the last film, has a price on his head which is increasing more than ever. The lethal unstoppable force of nature assassin now must fight against the High Table Global as he seeks out & fights the most deadly assassins players of the underworld from Paris to New York to Berlin to Japan. Will John Wick finally meet his match!?
Whoa...! Where do I start!? I found the film for starters to be too long!! At a whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes this film is way, way, way too long! The pacing... whoa! Don't get me started! I was willing to be tolerant & forgive the pacing, but when it got to the final leg it took the absolute puss & started to test my nerves! The story is so weak I had to look this film up in order to get what the plot was, again, another sign that the film was going to be bad, the first was the runtime, which I knew was going to be bad from the word go!
The film took a while to get going which was a pain, but it got there I guess! The fights were good, as with the John Wick films typically are, not to mention funny & brutal! But all things considered, it got repetitive fast & annoying especially near the end as I just mentioned! The story scenes were alright as with the villains & bad guys though again, it got repetitive & irritating.
The realism was stretch beyond its limits here in this film. John Wick fell from a great height on a metal pipe which looked to have (& lets be honest here) would've snapped his back like a tooth pick! John got hit by a car 5 times yet never suffers any bad injuries or dies! Yet a few bullet wounds finally kill him at the end (another downer of this film which I'll touch up on in a second!), the fight scenes in the night club where only a few people stood there shocked while about 95% just kept on dancing! Face palm! There were several other scenes which made you just think ""dafuq!?""
The lead up to the end was annoying! Just when you thought John Wick was going to go to the Stand Off with the blind villain, there was more fight scenes! Don't get me wrong, these fights where good, but annoying & held the film up for a good 20 minutes before the finale which to say the least, was anti climatic! The scene on the 122 steps was irritating & made you just scoffs in frustration when John got kicked down those steps which for a couple of seconds in its self, dragged & felt & looked comical! It's like getting so far in a mission in Grand Theft Auto V then dying & reverting back to the latest checkpoint where you have to start all, over, again!! The same feelings of that (from experience) where felt for me in this film from that scene!
Then of course, after John Wick killing 180 odd people (or more, I lost count obviously) he finally dies! What!? Like James Bond in that god awful Bond Film of 2021 No Time To Die!? Can't be!? What a poor show! Anyhow, to give you guys some perspective on how long this is in comparison to the rest of the films in the franchise! Without credits as they don't count!
John Wick (2015) - 1 hour 30 minutes John Wick 2 (2017) - 1 hour 50 minutes John Wick 3 (2019) - 1 hours 57 minutes John Wick 4 (2023) - 2 hours 39 minutes
Notice how the films got long & long with each entry...!
Overall, this ranks as they absolute worst of the franchise! I was willing to forgive the poor pacing & overly bloated runtime, but it got on my nerves too much to bare & when I saw that John Wick died!? Nope, that was it for me! The editing was poor with this film whoever edited this needs class in editing as this was bad beyond belief! The pacing also was poor combined with the bad editing! The fights were good, but too drawn out, long & annoyingly repetitive! The ending was both bad & anti climatic! How this film has 95% on RT is beyond me! But then what do I expect...! This ranks as the worst John Wick film in the franchise! With word of a female spin-off coming out (which will be bad), I've lost hope in this franchise! Let's hope John Wick 5 (if ever) redeems this kak entry!

tt10366206;John Wick: Chapter 4;navendu_krishnan;"Unpopular Opinion - John Wick 4 is a below average movie.
I loved all 3 John wick movies, but this one is more likely a conclusion of John wick series, So the fight scenes are boring and repetitive. Previous movies had different types of action and stunt choreographies. This one has long same fights , might be in different locations.
As far Keanu goes, his close up shots or his face doesnt appear in the movie atleast for a half time. John wick past movies had few dialogues but it had an impact, 4 has same few dialogues but it was very plain and flat.
Ending is Spoiler - John Wick Dies (or not) shown in a way that if there is a possibility of a sequel , there can be.
May stunts shots and its accuracy is totally gone, we can clearly see that where the gun is aimed and it just went like a paper plane. Even with the so-called Coat Armour, some pistol shots were directly aimed at Head / Leg which was again repelled with the armor which is in the shoulder.

It's horrible, it doesn't make any sense, just killing people, but how can it be possible that those people after being shot many times, were able to fight as nothing happened to them? And the plot? Trying to kill John Wick in any way possible, period.
The worst thing is that they used some scenes from the movie The Warriors (1979), they didn't try to change anything, a black woman with nice big lips, talking on the radio, guiding the gangs with the purpose to chase and kill The Warriors. Same with John Wick, but of course with a modern technology. Shame on you! Didn't you have any better idea? You just copied an old movie that was much better than this one, and that soundtrack was great!
What a disappointment! It remembers somehow Kill Bill, but that movie was very good, this one is almost unacceptable!
I enjoyed the other movies about John Wick, they were very well done, and had a good plot. This time it seems like they didn't know what to write.

tt6718170;The Super Mario Bros. Movie;benjaminskylerhill;"Granted, this film is not going to appeal to people who have never been fans of any games featuring the titular brothers. But given the fact that these filmmakers were tasked with making a movie that caters to a fan base that spans four decades and thus have a myriad of tastes and expectations, they did a pretty good job. In fact, a slightly better job than I was expecting.
The voice cast was the subject of much controversy, and I thought that for the most part it was actually spot-on. A couple of characters were horribly miscast in my opinion, but in particular Jack Black as Bowser and Charlie Day as Luigi shine as perfectly encapsulating the spirit of the characters.
Platforming elements from the games was very efficiently worked into the action sequences, and some of them were quite thrilling. This is easily Illumination's most visually stunning film, and a massive step up from every one of their other films since the first Despicable Me.
As for the plot, it's just the plot of every Mario game. And for the most part, that's all it needs to be. Every beat plays out almost exactly like you'd expect it to, with a couple subversions pleasantly thrown in there.
The messiest parts of the movie, if I'm going to get critical, are the dialogue (which is often quite stupid) and the characters. They just try to deal with too many of them, and although four or five characters are strongly introduced with background and desires, almost none of these introductions actually amount to a payoff, and even when there is a payoff, it's haphazardly thrown together for a rushed ending.
Although I think 85-90 minutes is actually the perfect length for an animated film normally, this one could've benefitted from an extra 10-20 minutes to flesh out these points a bit more. We move so quickly from location to location that there's never any time to breathe or get invested.
But that's my adult perspective. I had a pretty breezy, fun, and heartwarming time, though I would've liked more meat on the script.

Mario joins Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) to recruit the Kong army in their fight against the evil turtle Bowser (Jack Black). Luigi gets captured.
It's brightly colored. It's energetic. It's got the characters. There's the game play. The story is fairly simple. It's pretty much what I expected. I wish there is more heart to it.

tt6718170;The Super Mario Bros. Movie;folk_egm;"This is a movie that feels like a love letter to all the Nintendo fans out there, even if they don't necessarily play Mario anymore. The film delivers a fun and enjoyable experience for viewers by faithfully adapting every aspect of the game into the movie, including the Mario Kart and Donkey Kong franchises. The movie is packed with non-stop action and fast-paced storytelling, leaving little room for some of the more significant elements that fans might have wanted to see. It may not be able to fulfill every fan's wishes, but it's understandable and sets up for a sequel, as there is a post-credits scene.
But for general audiences who are not familiar with Mario enough, this might be a movie that is difficult to understand. There may be questions like why does it have to be like this? Why do it this way? Why is the world so strange? This is because the story hardly explains in detail for us to know how the world is. Even though the story is simple and has nothing much.

I remember playing Mario kart double dash on GameCube 20 years ago with my sister during Christmas Day and I absolutely loved the game . Universal and Nintendo did a great job making this movie for kids and adults who played the video game since the 80s 90s 2000s to now . The Mario movie was absolutely awesome and very creative from the video game . Chris was absolutely hilarious as Mario . Jack black as bowser was the best for the film. His voice was a mixture of Vader which I find so outstanding. Chris who voiced Mario did a fantastic job. He used the characters voice very carefully. The sounds were just like the video game. And i think that was absolutely awesome. The story taking place in New York to the mushroom kingdom is brilliant. Princess peach was the best part of the movie . She had a good way of showing bowser she will not marry a turtle . And toad was the best part of the movie . The rest of the characters including donkey Kong voiced by Seth rogen was so awesome.

Good sense of humour and a lot of nice scenes. A lot of laughable moments. Apart from the film being too short it still met my expectations.

The plot is very simple which is good however because a Mario story shouldn't be complex at all and the people at illumination definitely know how the games should be.

tt6718170;The Super Mario Bros. Movie;movies_are_life_;"Sometimes you come across a movie that takes no risks. It's light on story, avoids character development, and focuses on getting to the next scene as easily as possible. Mario Bros. Doesn't have any inherent plot holes or issues, but it tends to leave you in a state of just being a viewer rather than participating in the movie. In the end, it's not bad per se, but comes off as flat and lifeless.
The positives are all agreed upon by anyone who likes it, because the positives stand out by not being able to be compared against anything else. People have fun with the action. They love the Easter eggs. And the composed music is good. The action is done well, but without much dramatic weight, only carry the movie so far. Easter eggs don't nor should have any bearing on how good the ovoid is. The music was well incorporated, minus the pop songs that truly don't work.
It's not good enough to play things easy, and rely on fans to spot visual Easter eggs, to call the movie good. It's average at best mostly because it was watchable and didn't have any outright flaws. It just didn't take chances that could've ended up becoming flaws. Even if you had a good time watching it, there's not enough value to see it again. If you're a fan, check it out.

A movie that has all of the elements you'd want represented from Super Mario bros video games, and as a bonus, it also showcases Mario cart and donkey kong junior. The animation is strong, the worlds are exactly like the video games and truly fun moments for kids. The runtime is great and the movie moves along without pause.
AND I expect better, higher quality movie making.
The voice acting in this movie is so lazy. Chris Pratt is forgettable-anyone could have done better voicing such a beloved character. Princess Peach is the same - voice acting is boring and fairly emotionless. The worst voice acting belongs to Seth's terrible Donkey Kong junior - not a single attempt to make an actual character voice, just Seth's normal voice slapped on Donkey Kong. Toad's voice acting is also meatless and without any real jokes.
The script is mostly empty and there is little to no attempt at character motivation, organic character decision making - for example, why Princess Peach tells Mario he can come with her to save her kingdom. Almost every opportunity to make a joke is skipped. None of the characters have stated goals aside from King Koppa.
And saddest of all to me, there is no attempt to create backstory or give context to these beloved worlds and characters.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15348403/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9008749/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-04-21

They even had unique aspects given to them that helped them stand out in all the right ways. The action was phenomenal with great depth and detail that shows how much work was put into this. There were so many nods and references to other classic Nintendo properties that you'd want to go back to find them all. And Charles Martinet is in this with a small but great role. But with all that said, it does mess up its flow with some of the music. Definitely not the original score though, since it mixes the classic music with an epic and emotional tone.

tt6718170;The Super Mario Bros. Movie;Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187;"**Possible Spoilers**
30 years since 1993's fever dream live-action nightmare, The Super Mario Bros. Movie rights the wrongs of the last one; though it's certainly not a perfect movie, it's perfectly fine for what it is, and as family entertainment goes I've seen far worse than it. And with the gorgeous animation, the faithfulness to the games and the music, Chris Pratt and co. Do their best with the same old 'Mario comes to save Peach' storyline being worn thin at this point.
Sure the film's problems can be dissected to the nth degree on YouTube retrospectives talking about the movie, but it is what it is and it works where other blockbuster fan-service vehicles have failed (like Terminator: Dark Fate, Ghostbusters 2016 or The Lion King 2019). And Mario (at least Nintendo) has the potential to become a cinematic powerhouse that defies the 'bad' press and reviews (they're more mixed for the movie).
The film is basically feature-length comfort food more than anything else; and considering it's a family film that's pretty harmless, I'd say it's done its job more than well. Certainly better than Illumination's other more recent films I'd say.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the safest kind of cinema, and maybe some people should accept what they see; but not everyone has to. Besides, fun is fun. 3.5/5 stars.
P. S. Could this film lead to other stuff like Zelda hitting the big screen? Or maybe even Metroid? Who knows?";7;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24085266/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8973097/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-04-05

As a gamer, this movie was a promiseland I wish I could stay in forever. Admittedly, I was sceptical about Chris Pratt voicing everyone's favourite Italian plumber, but he did a superb job and he deserves a lot of praise for his dedication to the role. From learning about power-ups, to fighting against Donkey Kong, and to racing along the infamous Rainbow Road with all the drifts we've all performed countless times on MK8 and its predecessors, this movie is a huge dose of nostalgia for millennials, and a nice introduction for the younger generations.
My hat goes off to Mr Jack Black for his awesome job bringing the big, bad Bowser to life on the silver screen.

tt6718170;The Super Mario Bros. Movie;knives123;"I love Mario, and I enjoyed this movie, and so did my 7y/o. But with that out of the way I'll be honest - this movie is quite bad, as movies go. The story is barely present, every scene leads into the next with very little plot or agency - things just happen, characters just need things, that place is suddenly a karting city, that other place has an elevator leading up to a castle straight up a cliffface. The script is probably just screams and the a few catchphrases. It's all held together by nostalgia baiting, references and pandering, wrapped in Minions slapstick. It is all barely coherent. There is also a thing to be said about the music which was murdering classic tunes, some of which is just shockingly bad.
Is it a Mario movie? Sure. Is it a fun Mario product for the whole family? Yup. Is it a good movie? No, not really, in fact I'd give it a 6 if I am honest; not awful, but that's about it. So if you are 8 or a Mario fan - sure, you are likely to have a blast. But if you're just a person looking for a fun animation movie wholy uninvested in Mario?

Though admittedly kinda unnecessary, I really enjoyed watching the Mario Kart section. Same with the Luigi stuff, especially the ""you just got Luigi'd"" line. Though there are some other problems like Toad not really being funny, and this movie is kinda boring sometimes, but it's mostly pretty entertaining. So overall, solid 7/10 movie, must watch for Mario fans but it may not be for everyone else. If you want a Mario film that's an actual masterpiece, go watch Cute Mario Bros The Third Movie.

tt6718170;The Super Mario Bros. Movie;namob-43673;"The headline basically tells the story. This is not a good movie. Anyone who claim this is a great fantastic movie probably have some issues. But this is neither as horrible as I see some people argue. This is just a middle-of-the-road sometimes funny decently entertaining movie with bad music and very lazy writing.
The good is that this is decently fun, even funny a few times. And if you are a fan of the games, especially Mario Cart, you will smile through many scenes. The voice acting is great, and if you are a simple kid you are likely going to love this. Sadly there ends the good stuff.
The bad starts with the story, or rather lack thereof. Because it is as simplistic as the games which is both a strength and a weakness, but mostly a weakness because this movie offers nothing. It is actually kinda soulless and cliche. The music is mostly atrocious. Just put on Mario Cart music on bad speakers and you basically have this movie. But what really bothers me though is that the lack of story and very simplistic writing which feels so lazy. No one really cared. They only wanted to make a fast paced Super Mario Movie with as many callbacks and in-house jokes as possible, and that is it. There is no deeper meaning, nothing new, no real character development, nothing worth noting. Also most of the fun stuff you already saw in the trailer, it is not much else. So lazily done.
Sure you might have fun watching this, because it is not a bad movie, but will you remember this a few weeks from now? Will this be a classic? Do you want to see more? The answers to those questions is a big ""No"".

The Critic score should not be taken seriously it's nowhere near a bad nor average movie. There are some things that i didn't like about it but overall i left the theaters with a smile.
The Visuals are probably the best Illumination Studios has ever done, very smooth and gorgeous to look at. The human characters like Mario, Luigi and Peach's faces look different from their videogame counterparts and kind of weird at first but you will get used to them and at least their clothing match but on the other hand the animals and creatures from the Mushroom Kingdom like the Koopas, Donkey Kong and Bowser all look very accurate and detailed.
The Voice Acting, Sorry but Mario does NOT sound like Mario, at all in this movie! I'm not a fan of Chriss Pratt's acting as Mario. Luigi sounds better but not accurate either, Peach is good i guess and Donkey Kong sounds like Seth Rogen...Yay... Bowser however, gets a straight 10/10 Jack Black actually tried to sound like Bowser and he should be cast again as Bowser in future movies. Long time Mario fans will be surprised to know that Charles Martinet is also in the movie, but not as Mario... The character he got to act for is such a waste and not even worth mentioning to be honest.
The Story is not your typical Mario videogame story, it's actually baffling at first how literal they took the Mario ""origin"" story of him being a New York plumber. The movie starts going in the wrong direction but as the movie goes on it becomes better and better and ultimately it worked in the end. The pacing is very fast there is no real character development except for Luigi and maybe Mario but there's just too many relevant characters and not enough time to flesh them out. At least they all have defined personalities.
Overall, it's not an Amazing movie but definitely a fun and good first outing by Nintendo and Illumination, it's full of Mario references and just good fan service like a Mario movie should be. Here's hoping future Mario movies!!

Pacing is terrific, visit the loo or go for a drink at your peril, you may just miss something.
I think this is a film that fans of Spider Man, any fans, new or old will enjoy, its appeal is so broad.
I'm not a die hard Spidey fan, so some of it went over my head, but I am reliably informed by my fellow cinema goers that there were plenty of Easter eggs to hunt, lots of references to all forms of Spider Man.
Shameik Moore did a first rate job, as did Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen, her character development was a key element.

tt9362722;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse;rickothan;This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece.;10;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112178336/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9094673/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-02
tt9362722;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse;hectorvernet;"First off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn't have ""Part One"" in the title. It doesn't really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it's kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can't wait to see the next one.
Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of ""Into the Spider-Verse"", then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it's crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.
The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I'm even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn't been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.
One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can't take too many points off for that though.
The soudtrack is great, I can't wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.
And the story is awesome as well, although again it's hard to judge before seeing the next one. There's a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it's awesome. It's still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.
So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time.";10;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur128562289/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9091969/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-31
tt9362722;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse;rgkarim;"LIKES:
The Pace For The Most Part -Comic book movies are an art that requires balance to tell all it has to tell, and Miles' next story.. has A LOT to tell.
-It found a good pace for me to tell the story, giving you the character development, but not at a pace that was too slow and lost on itself, for the most part.
-Yet, the movie did manage to keep it slow enough that there was real development, build up, hints, and appreciation to age like fine wine.
-This dynamic was very impressive to me, keeping an engaging movie for my attention, but not skimping out on the action like some of these deeper movies try to do.
-That takes talent in the cooking pot as big as this, building on the past movie, but yet doing its own thing until the end for the setup.
The Voice Acting -Everyone rocks in this movie, and I have to agree with my friend that it is grade A on many levels with what you get in live action movies.
-Isaac is still strong as the anti-hero role that he often plays. His moodiness, his anger, his dark edge are mirrored in the character. There is hurt, anguish, and the fire that he shows so well, and I love how his voice is the main focus in his performance and not the looks.
-Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic in Gwen. It's like taking all of her characters from her movie and integrating a piece of them into this Gwen and expanding her far into a character I really liked.
-She was vulnerable and strong, a realistic character whose performance came out in spades and fully awakened the character I think they were going for.
-And Moore... well Moore is just freaking amazing as Morales. That tone, vulnerability, this maturity but still immaturity cascading and once more evolving a character from the first one being believable. A stellar performance and one that I think brought so many things together, engaging with each of the others into this dynamic role.
-It all works so well and I loved the strong talent bringing things to life.
The Storytelling -There are so many who say that comic movies seldom tell a good story or are telling the same story over and over again. And to a degree... they are right.
-Yet... for Across the Spider-Verse, that story feels fresh, engaging, and grounded to a degree that helps balance reality and super heroism into a great mashup.
-It's not so in your face super adventures that are all about action, violence, and CGI madness, but it also isn't CW bologna about exploring our feelings in colorful underwear.
-This sequel really focuses so much on building up characters, but integrating it into this main comic adventure that works to keep both involved and feel like a superhero.
-I love the heart into it, and the way they built up from the first movie, but yet made this movie its own thing, until the final moments where the known cliffhanger was going to come in.
-And to add relative components to it, engaging characters, and keeping those characters involved in the story... that is tough work.
The Comedy To A degree -I really enjoyed the diverse comedy in this movie, and how many types of jokes and styles that were in it.
-Miles is sort of a jack of all trades, sarcasm, banter, slapstick, he has a little bit of everything in it and I love it.
-Others are just rambling idiots who are throwing so many jokes and statements that some eventually hit, but you have to listen because they fluctuate in terms of volume and such.
-And other jokes are so well-timed and loaded with sarcasm that you just appreciate the laugh from the time alone.
-It has it all and in relative balance to keep things fresh and not overwhelmingly stale as they hope from one joke to the other.
The Nostalgia and Easter Eggs -Part of that comedy comes in the references loaded into this movie almost as much as the plot in this movie, and it works.
-Across the Spider-Verse, tackles many famous tropes in both Spiderman comics and movies, blending the two of them together into this natural flowing arc that utilizes it well.
-Nostalgia reigns supreme in this movie, all the comic and show references of the webbed wonder just taking my child nature and taking it for the roller coaster ride of finding everything I could.
-But the movie references as well... so much fun as well, seeing these micro moments and nods to the other universes and watching them blended into the comedy and story.
-Then to have it just in the world, it's going to make for a fun rewatch potential in the future.
The Action Scenes -A huge step up, Across the Spider-Verse took my dislike from the first film and unleashed much more of the action I knew it had.
-The opening scene paints for some great things to come, but soon the fight scenes and adventure transform into something that is fun, exciting, and family friendly.
-Chase scenes have energy, with styles that flow and show off the heart of the animation, feels of the comic book and fan art coming together into this cascade of color and energy.
-I loved the way that they evolved past punches and added more emotions and stakes that though predictable still held glimmer of exciting twists if they come.
-And the fact they can punch, kick, and slam without being bloody messes should please so many, alongside the fact that the action all goes in line with the actual plot.
The Animation/Art Style -You've seen the trailers and the first one and know how beautiful the movie is. Amidst the blurry backgrounds, the movie really has bold art direction that captures comic book spirit.
-The computer animation goes well with the natural feel of the art, and I loved the way it felt like flipping through a flip book and seeing it come to life.
-It respects both worlds so well, and like the story keeps things easy to follow and discover to appreciate everything the Spider-Verse had to offer. That was epic.
-And to keep all that in relatively stable camera work, something the first movie struggled with, shows how you can really continue to improve if you take the time and think things through.
DISLIKES:
The Comedy A Bit Too Forced -There are times where the humor is a bit forced for me, primarily in the moments where they just spout joke after joke after joke to the point where things get lost.
-These moments are few and far between for me, but there are times where a character gets annoying over funny.
Some Pacing Offsets -There are times where the movie trips up on the pace for me. A few moments where the conversations are dragged out or we get a tad touchy feeling and not enough of seeing what's going on.
-This happened about the first hour or so for me, but once that part passes most of the movie establishes the pace I talked about for much of the movie.
-At least until the need.
The Ending 20 minutes for me -The ending 20 minutes felt very dragged out as it set up the cliffhanger we knew was coming the moment it said part 1 long ago.
-The ending is very drawn out, you know the movie is over, and you know what is coming, but it uses the art to drag it out, bloating the movie for the twenty minutes that could have been in the next movie.
-Fortunately one of the final moments adds that fantastic bridge with music, shots, and feels that work, but still... we could have cut a few things out.
-And fortunately there are no end credits, which there does not need to be.
The Sound Quality With Some Characters -It might have been my theater, but some of the characters mumble and talk fast meaning... it's hard to hear them.
-Spider-Punk has some of the best lines, but they get drowned out by background noise, mumbling speakers, and sound inconsistencies.
-This leads to missing several things and taking away from the character that seems so cool, and this happens to several other characters when there is so much noise. As such, those moments are annoying to me, but again could be theater dependents.
The VERDICT: Overall, the praise is worthy to Across the Spider-Verse, and I was very happy with much of the film that they brought to life to this theater. It's a sequel that does things right, taking the first movie's foundations and bringing with it something to build up and enjoy to the full extent. That bold and beautiful art has been refined to near perfection, and does so much storytelling alone that it's almost enough to go see it just for that in theater. But the movie integrates story, morals, comedy, nostalgia, and action to a degree that really feels like some of the strongest storytelling in a superhero movie. I love the authentic feel of a superhero story, and I love the passion of balancing so much in a movie without every losing track of the story to tell. Sure there were pacing issues and some sound flops for me, but that's really minor when it comes to the movie overall and everything they did to make this movie the middle of the trilogy, but still stand on its own. You can obviously guess I'm recommending this for the theater, and yes families can see it as there aren't too much dark moments. And my scores for those who need it are:

This is easily, without a shadow of a doubt, the film of the year. It perfectly balances humour and emotional beats on a razor thin blade. It's richly layered, complex and the attention to detail is absolutely incredible. The story is phenomenal, the characters are believable and have excellent levels of depth, the soundtrack is fantastic. My expectations were completely exceeded, I spent the entire 2h 30m runtime in awe. But one thing above all deserves very special praise :
THE ARTWORK.
This films aesthetic is jaw-dropping, I found myself plunged (for the second time now) straight into the pages of a comic book from my youth. The use of colour is remarkable, the animation is smoother than silk, the textures, the backgrounds, the lighting, the style itself - everything blends together perfectly to create one of the most visually stunning things ever committed to the screen. Almost any shot could be a painting, with inextricable layers upon layers of marvellous detail, hand-crafted by some extremely talented individuals. This is cinema.

It takes everything that was great about the first film and elevates it to a whole new level. I have honestly never witnessed such remarkable animation as in ""Across the Spider-Verse.""

It is a true multiverse experience, with an abundance of captivating details in every frame, including numerous Easter eggs and a vibrant color palette. I found myself not wanting it to end, despite its substantial length. Knowing that the next part will be released in 2024 brings me immense joy because waiting a few more years to see how this story unfolds would be agonizing.

Bonding with character hasn't been as easy as it is here, they really explore the backgrounds of the different characters so emotional and passionately at the same time.
It's a necessary darker & more emotional storyline for the characters but that's just how Peter Parkers storyline is... It's a 2h20 movie but there wasn't one scene that I would've left out, I would've even preferred for it to go at almost 3h cause I wasn't a huge fan of the ending! You'll know when seeing it!

Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler.

tt9362722;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse;MatthewMichaelHoffman;"SCORE: 10/10
I am still processing this storytelling masterpiece. Before I get into the review, huge shoutout to my cousin for being an Associate Editor on this project. It was so amazing seeing his name, R. Chett Hoffman, in the credits. Such a proud and inspirational moment. He will go down in cinema history for helping create one of, if not the greatest animated movie of all time.
When I say greatest animated movie of all time, I'm not saying that from a story perspective. I'm saying it while taking into account both the story and the animation style. The story was still fantastic and crafted well, but something like Toy Story is just going to be hard to beat for me, which is just personal preference at the end of the day. For a comic book movie, you can't get any better animation style put to screen. It's innovative, way ahead of its time, and unlike anything I've ever seen. Once Miles shows up to the place that the rest of the Spider-People are, the story takes a completely different form. It goes from setup to every Spider-Man fan's dream. It truly had something in there for everyone. Not only were the cameos and use of the Spider-World very well thought out and effective, but the plot of the movie finally comes together and reveals the meaning behind everything that has been going on.
When I saw the canon thing show up on Gwen's watch, I was confused at first. It's probably the dyslexic in me, but I was thinking cannon like the weapon. Once Miguel started explaining Miles' place in all of this and how each Spider-Man story has followed a canon story, it all made sense to me. You hear the word canon thrown around a lot in a franchise to ask if certain projects are ""canon"" to the bigger story being told. Using Uncle Ben's death as the main focus point of the canon was genius, which allowed them to include the coolest cameos of the entire film in Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire. There were so many more, but those 2 stuck out to me, just like the other ones did for people who had connections with the other Spider-People. One connection we all shared was with the group formed in Into The Spider-Verse, which all came back in a big way. All of these amazing cameos and references made the story fun and exciting, but it wasn't what made it the most meaningful.
The most meaningful part of the story was discovering that Miles wasn't supposed to be bit in the first place, and that he was the first ever anomaly. From that moment on, everything starts to come together and make sense, with twists and turns in the story happening one after another. That is, until we are brought to the biggest twist of them all. Miles travels back to the Earth that originally contained the spider that bit him, Earth-42. With the absence of Spider-Man, was Miles just a normal kid? What things unfolded by having the canon broken in this Universe? We find out that the Prowler still lives, but the identity of the Prowler is unknown. That leaves us to the ultimate cliffhanger for Part 1, where it is revealed that Miles had become the Prowler in that Universe. Seeing the duality of Miles as Spider-Man and the Prowler was the PERFECT way to leave us wanting more and to cap off this amazing film. I know that will be up for debate until we see Beyond the Spider-Verse, which comes out at the end of March 2024, but I thought it was an awesome twist.
To be fair, the first part of the movie started off really slow. The length of time Miles was at odds with his parents and concealing his identity lasted too long. It was important to set the scene, but I feel like the beginning dragged on for longer than it needed to. That's literally the only bad thing I can say about it. Everything else was perfect and I think it is better than the original, only by a little. It was beautiful, it was breath taking, and it was mastery on full display.";10;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur152799620/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9097746/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-03
tt9362722;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse;matris1;"The good: This is a gorgeous and competently made film. With every scene / direction / frame constructed meticulously and it shows. It pushes the boundaries of animated movies and does it with style. The voice acting is good. The movie respect and pays homage to spider-man lore whilst offering something fresh (had to pull off). Almost all the side characters feel real and fleshed out - even those with minimal screen time.
The bad: It's most definitely a middle chapter and the film suffers for it. The movie is long, the pacing suffers, and scenes feel drawn out - which makes sense when you understand it's not trying to reach the end. The movie 'finishes' literally in the middle of a plot beat - when it didn't need to. Empire Strikes Back has shown us how it's done. It feels like pure marketing/money making tactics. A shame.
Should you watch it: If you like Into the Spider-Verse - most definitely. The film pays homage to spider-man while offering something new. It's also just a brilliantly made animated film. Highly recommended.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1577793/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9097428/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-03
tt9362722;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse;ayoreinf;"I was really blown away by this masterpiece. It's beautiful, clever, funny and deep. And it dares being a comics in each and every frame. It never allows you to forget these are drawn characters you see. Unlike so many animated movies of recent time it doesn't go for the smooth polished look it makes certain we never forget that we watch a comics book that was brought to life on screen. Just like Rembrandt made sure we all see his brush strokes when we watch his paintings. But just like Rembrandt, it's done without allowing the technical mastery of it all to drop one little bit. But it's way more than simple issue of the looks of it. This is comics all the way, thematically as well as visually, hence the ending we got.
They didn't give up on anything; didn't allow a single detail to go amiss. They wouldn't give up on any bit of storytelling. It's all there, no matter how long the final cut will be, and still, it's not too long not even a second too long. The characters are all fully developed - real human beings drawn in comics form, but human just like any of us watching them on screen. It calls for some of the best voice acing I've seen, by each and every member of the cast. I simply can't single out anyone of them. They were all superb.
And than the story itself - It's way more than just sci-fi comics. It doesn't limit itself to the usual issues of power and its moral implications. It's asking us the deep questions of what determines the path our life take? Are we ruled by our destiny? Is it all written in our stars? If I had a problem with most of the comics I read it was because of the fatalistic approach adopted by most of them. This one defies the tradition in the best way. It breaks down all the accepted rules and leaves us all hanging in one of the best cliff hangers ever.

I'd definitely suggest seeing this at the cinema because the use of colours and the work which has gone into the animations is undoubtedly the highlight, I actually can't think of a more visually creative movie I've seen. Great soundtrack too, and quite funny. One of my criticisms is it's got that ""Deadpool"" kind of style where literally everything is tongue in cheek, it needed more genuinely serious scenes just to break it up. Like there are these big arguments and then a joke is thrown in half way through, who does that? Also it's got quite bad dialogue but it's a family superhero movie so I went in expecting that, only a minor point really.
Real rating - 7/10: it's half a movie man!! It's a part 1, and I feel a bit cheated that I went in not knowing that. There was commotion in the cinema when it ended, a lot of people were annoyed. I just don't get this trend in cinema, for me a great movie needs to be able to stand on its own. 2h30 is plenty of time to tell a compelling story without ending on a cliffhanger. Think the plot would've been better suited to a series format - it's already kind of like a high budget Arcane in feel - but obviously that wouldn't work with the first movie and it wouldn't make as much money. To make it a great movie they should've dissolved one of the sub plots and actually finished it.";7;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur131755301/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9096368/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-02

The story: well done
The characters: convincing and well-developed
The themes in this movie are very good, and they're told in a thought out and mature way. In other words, it's not afraid to make you feel things and maybe scare your kids a little, despite the PG rating.

tt9362722;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse;ykjdh;"This might possibly be one of the best movies I've seen all year. I'll definitely put it in my top two for the year. The comics look better in animation in my opinion and the design of this super man looked great in IMAX.
If there's anything to complain about, it might be the running time which with previews ran around 2hrs and 25 min. Like a lot of good action movies thought it seem to go by pretty fast. The movie doesn't drag and does a good job with its pacing.
This time around Miles Morales finds his spdey going across dimensions to save the universe. I'm not revealing any spoilers but let's just say for the fans of the comics, this one stays true to the material. The soundtrack isn't bad either and helps with the pacing.

tt9362722;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse;FeastMode;"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the first of a two part movie. These studios should be legally required to put ""part 1"" in the title. Fast X did the same thing and I felt unsatisfied when the movie abruptly ends with everything completely unresolved.
Now Across the Spider-Verse endlessly better, but I still had that unsatisfied feeling when I realized I was watching the first half of a really long movie. So much is set up in the first act, including a cool villain, and is left completely unresolved.
Think about your favorite movies. Now imagine that when you saw them for the first time, someone cut it off halfway through and made you wait a year for the rest. A movie needs to be able to stand on its own.
Aside from that, I pretty much love this movie. I don't think it's as good as the original, but that's a high bar. The animation is incredible, especially during a long intro scene in a different universe. There are so many different styles and techniques. The characters are awesome, as are the ideas in this story.
My only real issue is that the story felt a little messy and all over the place. But that made way more sense when I realized it was half of a movie. That's why we're still getting setup and introducing conflicts late in the movie. We'll have to wait and see how the second part pulls it all together. I also found the sound a little low during the action scenes and sometimes had trouble hearing the dialogue, even in Dolby Atmos.
I already can't wait to see the next one. And if it does everything right, I can see myself raising the score for this one. I had a great time with Across the Spider-Verse. I also feel a bit unsatisfied.
EDIT: On second viewing, I feel the same. It's awesome, but it's not complete. Instead of exciting escalation to a beastly climax, in the last half hour we get setup.

Speaking of Miles, he's really matured in this part, he's just a 15 year old kid who has to balance his Spider-man lifestyle with himself, I like the way Miles tackles problems differently from the rest of Spider-Man .

tt5090568;Transformers: Rise of the Beasts;kevin_robbins;"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows a planet eater out for a stone that will allow him to travel throughout space and time to find planets to consume. The ancient animal transformers protect the stone and have traveled to Earth to hide themselves and the stone. When autobots that support the planet eater arrive on Earth to find the stone the transformers and animal transformers will need to work together to protect the stone.
This movie is directed by Steven Caple Jr. (Creed II) and stars Anthony Ramos (In the Heights), Dominique Fishback (Judas and the Black Messiah), Dean Scott Vazquez (In the Heights), Tobe Nwigwe (Mo) and Michael Kelly (Dawn of the Dead).
This storyline was really compelling and interesting. It was tremendous watching the animal and car transformer worlds combine. The CGI and special effects were outstanding and every action scene is a 10/10. I really adored every fight. However, we didn't need the humans in this at all, and the action, dialogue and plot points involving Ramos and Fishback were painful. They are good actors whose performances weren't good here and felt out of place. It's time to move on from the humans needing to be the heroes in these storylines...because the Transformers, both good guys and bad guys, were awesome.
Overall, this is a worthwhile addition to the Transformers series that I would strongly recommend. I would score this a 6/10.";6;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur131783850/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9114106/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-11

But I am ecstatic after watching the best Transformers movie since Dark of the Moon.
I found myself smiling for most of the runtime. For the first time in years, I kept thinking ""Transformers are so damn cool."" There are so many beautiful shots with these CGI creations, so many moments to screenshot the image and frame it. The action is miles better than the last three entries.
They fixed so many of the issues that plagued the last three movies. There are actual characters with motivations we understand, conflicts where we can see both sides of the argument. Even the Transformer characters are significantly more fleshed out. I felt for them.
There is an actual story instead of nonsense to move the plot forward. You don't even have to turn your brain off to enjoy it. And the comedy actually works! I laughed more times than the previous three movies combined.
This experience made me so happy, and I look forward to any future projects if this is the direction they're taking. It's a perfect example of how, if you do it right and create with care and passion, the result will be endlessly better.

This film suffers from a poor script, characters I couldn't care for, and it left me wanting. I must admit, though, this film looked surprisingly good in 3D.
Overall this film is very forgettable and doesn't do anything new. Also, with an ending that leaves me with more questions and thoughts of why, then necessary really brings everything down.

But is it entertaining? Depends on your definition. If you want to see robots and humans hunting MacGuffins, clashing and brawling for their respective fates, painfully cringe dialog and jokes, and a predictable plot? Then yes, it's entertaining.
I'm a sucker for 90s hip-hop, so hearing Tribe and Wu-Tang was a pleasant surprise. I also appreciate the dynamic lighting and how the robots are integrated into their environments. They don't stick out too much or look odd.
Until they talk. Then most of the immersion goes right out the window. Nearly every robot-spoken word is delivered with the gusto of the movie trailer voiceover guy bellowing cliches like ancient creeds.
And yet, as the 3rd act progressed I found myself starting to be won over, almost like a case of Stockholm Syndrome. Maybe because I stopped thinking about it. Maybe the movie itself became a visual lobotomy.

tt5090568;Transformers: Rise of the Beasts;rannynm;"Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts is a captivating film that blends comedy, action, adventure and drama. As a young film watcher, I was thoroughly impressed by the movie's ability to keep me entertained. One of the standout performances in the film is Mirage (Pete Davidson), who brings a delightful touch of comedy and showcases a genuine heart for humans.
The idea of the story revolves around the Maximals joining forces with Noah, (Anthony Ramos) and the Autobots as they work together to defeat the menacing Scourge (Peter Dinklage) and the Terrorcons in a battle that could potentially be the fate of the world.
Although the film takes a bit of time to build up in certain parts, it ultimately contributes to the overall experience. The camera work is flawless, providing a fresh and new perspective for viewers. Anthony Ramos delivers an outstanding performance as Noah Diaz, effectively portraying a range of emotions and going above and beyond to embody the character. Peter Cullen, the voice of the heroic Autobot Optimus Prime, presents a new side of Prime that we have never seen before, adding depth to the character. Peter Dinklage takes on the role of the perfect villain Scourge, adding a scary, creepy and dark twist to the story-a crucial element that superhero movies often need.
The message of ""never quit and keep getting back on your feet"" resonates strongly throughout the narrative. It's important to note that the film contains a significant amount of profanity.

tt5090568;Transformers: Rise of the Beasts;shaikhirshad-41223;Transformers is all about it's CGI, Action pieces and the emotions between the autobots and humans. And this movie has done that perfectly well. I would say it's not great as Michael Bay 1st transformers movie but it's not that bad at all. Action & CGI is terrific in this film. Specially the beast that has shown in the film was executed perfectly well. Background score justifies the film with proper sound effects whenever the action is going on. Story is just average as every transformers movie has and director should've worked on human characters to build-up their arcs because in some scenes they are just added without any reason. Human characters aren't build properly as they should. In some scenes human characters are forced just to keep for screen presence and conversation which is just average to watch. Autobots & Beast transformation is superb and whenever they comes on screen and transform it's just amazing to watch and specially the climax sequence where the fights between Autobots & Unicorn is just OUTSTANDING to watch. Direction & Screenplay is good nothing stretched and feels bored movie runs in a same pace and it'll hooked you up till the last.

tt5090568;Transformers: Rise of the Beasts;masonsaul;"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts combines the character focused approach of Bumblebee with the bombast of the previous Bay films for a great globe trotting adventure that wastes no time and strikes a much better balance in screen time given to its human and Transformers characters, even if the beasts themselves are actually surprisingly underutilized.
Anthony Ramos gives a really good lead performance, he's easy to root for and has genuinely strong relationships with Optimus Prime and Mirage. Mirage is the standout with Pete Davidson voicing the character, the constant quips never get annoying and he still has an emotional connection to Noah as well.
Peter Cullen is always perfect as Optimus Prime and this is undoubtedly some of his best work in the live action films. Its what Bay was going for in his later installments but done better, an Optimus Prime who's not the ideal leader but a selfish, broken one carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.
Steven Caple Jr.'s direction is strong overall, the fights can get a little chaotic but a second act chase and third act final battle are still a lot of fun. The music by Jongnic Bontemps wisely chooses to lay off the nostalgia for the most part, creating its own epic score and using classic pieces sparingly.
The soundtrack does a good job making it easy to adjust to the time jump and making it feel authentic and the CG is impressive overall. There's obviously a few weak spots throughout but it's still maintains that balance between realistic details and more animated flourishes.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur94560739/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9108764/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-08

Aside from a few moments involving these things, I was bored senseless by this movie.
I struggle to comprehend how a script like this passes so many hands and makes it to production; it has some of the worst dialogue this side of Attack of the Clones.
Everything in this movie is told to us, rather than creatively shown. It's obnoxious, it's lazy, and it's stupid. It treats us, the audience, like we're stupid as it spoon feeds every piece of information to us like we're infants, even though the story is really simple and nothing original or complex happens once.
All this could be saved if the action were entertaining and investing. But it isn't, aside from a handful of stylish shots.
Say what you will about Michael Bay's movies. (They're bad.) But at least they had huge scale to them and the stakes were understood.
This is a bland blockbuster movie, through and through. The action never features any destruction or threat to human life. There isn't a practical, real thing happening on screen.

First, the main (human) characters are absolutely boring, and seem to be in the film only to represent members of a ""marginalized community"". It was difficult to care about these characters at all. My first thought was that the acting was just plain - well, plain. My second thought was that it might also be that I fully expected each and every word that came out of their mouths. There was nothing about these characters that wasn't stereotypical, and certainly no depth to the characters. They were almost a meme.
My second problem was that from the beginning, I fully expected to see that, rather than help a car thief evade the police, Mirage would kick him to the curb, tied up in a ribbon. Okay, so I didn't fully expect it, not these days. Then, to make matters worse, the only thing that recommends him to go beyond the first meeting with the autobots is his ability to again, be used to steal something. So, we glorify a thief trying to make some scratch, and then we rely on him for more of the same.

Now that's what I call a revival. That was far and above the best Transformers movie made to date, and apparently this is the first film in a trilogy that is to come. This has me excited! They decided to finally pair the awesomeness that is the Transformers with a good story. I don't know why, but Pete Davidson as Mirage just works. He adds a new flavor to the franchise that felt much needed, and his comedic relief was well executed. The Maximals are some of the coolest Transformers we've ever seen and the relationship and connection between Optimus Primal and Optimus Prime was great. The villain for this movie was a cross between Thanos, Darkseid, and Ultron, and he wasn't just some scrub without a plan. All of the new pieces added to the franchise were spectacular, but this film really thrives because of the OGs.
Optimus Prime and Bumblebee shine bright in this one. In fact, Bumblebee gets to utter a phrase that is in my top tier of best movie lines ever spoken. I thought I wasn't hearing it correctly, but he really said, right before he deactivates, ""O Captain! My Captain!"". His rebirth and return to the battlefield was a major highlight of the film, but nothing tops Optimus Prime ripping Scourge's head off and Arrival to Earth playing as they escape. That was a little something for the people who had to suffer through the absolute garbage that was most of the Transformers franchise, but still love parts of it. New beginnings!
The one thing I couldn't get behind was the character of Elena. I don't know if it was the writing or the acting or a little bit of both, but her character felt so out of place. Anthony Ramos' performance was almost watered down because of his lack of chemistry where her and the noticeable drop off in acting when it cut to Elena.

tt5090568;Transformers: Rise of the Beasts;subxerogravity;"I have to start by saying that I was not expecting much from this movie so I'm thrilled with joy about how much I got from it. I think I'm bias because the movie takes place in 1994, a good year for me and a good time for music which was used very effectively to give you a vibe of New York (or rather Brooklyn) in general. I will be blunt on how the Black and Brown culture meshing with the Transformers also realty gave the franchise a breath of fresh air. It's strange how that works. Black and LantinX has existed forever yet somehow putting it in a movie franchise about giant robots from space gave it a uniqueness that gets attention.
As Martin Scorsese would say ""it's a roller coaster ride"", but I love roller coaster rides. The Action was fantastic beautiful visual scenes but I'll admit my one nick pick would be don't see it in 3D. The format flattens the visual effects making everything look faker than it already is.
Also love the interaction of the humans and Transformers. The Transformers have more personality now than they did as basic background for Michael Bay's film.

tt5090568;Transformers: Rise of the Beasts;afatedcircle;"The Transformers movies have always been more popcorn flick than anything. Huge Michael Bay explosions, some one liners and eye candy for the human actors/actresses. That being said, the last few movies haven't really had many memorable moments. Rise of the Beasts is no exception to that.
The soundtrack is straight 90s rap which makes complete sense seeing as the movie is set in 1994. The tracks work well with the segments of the movie they're featured in, especially one particular moment of LL Cool J's ""knock you out""
The cgi was pretty decent. I didn't really notice any flaws like I have with more recent movies like Fast 10 but that's to be expected with a highly CGI dependent movie.
The acting left a lot to be desired from the human characters. The eye candy didn't exist this time around but I imagine that was done for a reason. The problem is I didn't care for either of the human protagonists. I felt more connection to the younger brother of the male lead than I did the lead.
The Transformers are as entertaining as always and that should be the main draw of the movie. Bumblebee being sidelined for 90% of the film left room for Mirage to take the stage. There were a few good one liners from him but then they take him away at the climax to put on their own Ironman suit which quite honestly took away from the movie a bit.
Unicorn was supposed to be the big threat here but never felt threatening at all. Instead you get the 3 henchmen who were dominating the autobots early on yet in the main fight are easily disposed of.

I guess), the long distance build up for the re-introduction of Optimus Primal that are too long making it his appearance can be said not too much in the movie, and the exact problem from previous movies happening again, which is when they make Optimus Prime takes too much L, the way they make Optimus so weak neither in the beginning or in the middle while they always hailed him as the most powerful one and the legend and the leader of all Autobots kinda of pissed me off, that's basically most of my problem with the movie, while the goods of Rise Of The Beasts is of course the action, the battle scene are pretty exciting and the last battle was great, Anthony Ramos ok performance and characters itself overall is a W, all of the Autobots and the Maximals team were fine, Optimus got a lot of screen time, Noah's little brother and friend performance was fine, some cool and even funny scene, liked some of the soundtrack, and Scourge was a good villain, overall Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts is problematic and have a lot of flaws but it also still fills with entertaining action, villain, ok performance male lead, and not ridiculous main plot, it's not terrible but it's not amazing or incredible either, (the half plus score i gave for the movie is because Rise Of The Beasts have more stuff in it than the Bumblebee movie and that's why i am not giving it the same score which is only a 6 for Bumblebee).;6;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur105506099/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9109695/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-09

Michael Bay's 2007 original is A-OKAY and 2018's Bumblebee is solid, but in the 11 years between those, films like Revenge of the Fallen, The Last Knight and the rest are all varying levels of crap. Five years after the last movie, coming back to the world of robots in disguise, the bar is basically ""Please don't suck."" And we're happy to report that Transformers: Rise of the Beasts does not suck. It's actually quite entertaining, especially for a Transformers movie.
On plot terms alone, this sequel/prequel is packed with noggin-scratchers. Such as: why do the Maximals, these giant robo-animal-things lifted from a late 90s' toy line and kids' toon, have fur and feathers poking out between their metal bits? And if they're from another planet, why do they bother looking like Earth animals? Even on Earth, it isn't much of a disguise. How would a gorilla ever mistake the Mighty Joe Young-sized, steel-faced Optimus Primal - yes, that is his actual name and not a typo - for a potential mate? And another thing: if the Autobots have only been on Earth for seven years at this point, why is one of them (Stratosphere, voiced by John DiMaggio, aka Futurama's Bender) a rusty old World War II cargo plane?
But ultimately, Rise of the Beasts does what every Transformers movie has to do: wrap up with a seemingly endless fight sequence in which big, shiny chunks of metal slam noisily into each other. The smaller and more intimate special effects are more impressive than these massive set pieces; Mirage evolves in a multitude of cool ways that look tactile and realistic, for example. But while this climax isn't as dizzying and interminable as they so often are, it's still rather dull compared to the action that came before it.
Alien robot cars and their space battles are concepts with such basic, gee-whiz sci-fi appeal that they've worked numerous times across decades of comics and cartoons. And yet there's little childlike wonder to the Transformers live-action movies, which often stuff their frames with visually oppressive, eyesore conceptions of things that ought to be simple and imaginative. Virtually all of the Transformers movies feel like they're trying to defeat their audience, but this time, the movie wins.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26767722/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9105965/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-07
tt5090568;Transformers: Rise of the Beasts;Top_Dawg_Critic;"This was pure fun with tons of comedy - I can't recall laughing so much in a comedy film, let alone one that's not even listed as a comedy. Having Pete Davidson voice Mirage was brilliant and was literally the funniest character I've seen/heard in a long time.
When I first learned about all the new characters including the bots, I wasn't sure I'd like them, but every single one was excellent and added to the film. What I also liked was how there was more of a story - a great prequel, and less of the over-the-top Michael Bay mayhem of special effects. All S/VFX in this film were in perfect doses, very impressively done, and added to the story instead of detracting from it.
There was a great origin and current timeline story, superb character development, and thankfully, no cliched romance subplot. You will have a smile throughout this entire film, in between laughs and moments of awe during the impressive and stunning visual effects. This is what a Transformers movie should be - a tight narrative, clean action sequences and with tons of heart, whether human or bot. I'm just not sure about that business card organization at the end, but you never know, I never thought we'd get another great Transformers film either.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur64798417/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9129731/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-18
tt5090568;Transformers: Rise of the Beasts;iamianiman;"Rise of the Beasts opens with Noah who struggles to find a decent job to support his family and Elena who works in a museum and is interested in researching artifacts. But oh my, we couldn't care less about them. They really spent almost 30 minutes on their stories which as you can guess, are very bland and dull. Noah's story might seem relatable for some people as we're in a tough economy now but audience doesn't want you talking about finding a job. This ain't for the Oscar. And Elena barely has any story. We don't even know who she is. No really. Who is she? 😅😭

They could cut to the chase and skip some of the parts in the first act. It becomes worse when there's no comedy, everything is just so serious. A total opposite of Sam Witwicky (Shia Labeouf) and Mikaela's (Megan Fox) where comedy was top-notch and the plot was simple and fun. Even Sam's parents were comical. We're not exactly sure why they chose the serious road this time around, but we prefer Sam Witwicky's world.








Verdict: Incredibly better than Transformers 4 & 5, Rise of the Beasts offers itself to be quite entertaining with above-average action sequences and some genuinely WOW moments, thanks to its choreography and tracking shots. However, the uninteresting human drama and lack of comedy make this a subpar entry compared to the first three Transformers films.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur58447224/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9105981/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-07
tt5090568;Transformers: Rise of the Beasts;rexmatthewj;"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a thrilling and action-packed sequel to Bumblebee that introduces new factions of robots and a new threat to Earth. The movie follows Noah (Anthony Ramos), a former soldier and electronics expert, and Elena (Dominique Fishback), a museum intern and artifact researcher, who get involved in a war between the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), the Maximals, led by Optimus Primal (Ron Perlman), and the Terrorcons, led by Scourge (Peter Dinklage), who serve the planet-devouring Unicron (Colman Domingo). The movie is directed by Steven Caple Jr. And written by Joby Harold, Darnell Metayer, Josh Peters, Erich Hoeber, and Jon Hoeber.
The movie succeeds in delivering spectacular visual effects, stunning cinematography, and exhilarating fight scenes that showcase the diverse abilities and personalities of the Transformers. The movie also pays homage to the Beast Wars storyline from the animated series, featuring fan-favorite characters such as Cheetor (Tongayi Chirisa), Airazor (Michelle Yeoh), Rhinox (David Sobolov), and Nightbird (Michaela Jaé Rodriguez). The movie also introduces some new and interesting Transformers, such as Mirage (Pete Davidson), a spy who can turn invisible, Arcee (Liza Koshy), a female motorcycle bot who can hack any system, and Stratosphere (John DiMaggio), a cargo plane bot who can transport other Transformers.
The movie also benefits from having charismatic and relatable human leads, who have good chemistry and humor. Ramos and Fishback play Noah and Elena as ordinary people who get caught up in an extraordinary situation, but also have their own dreams and struggles. Ramos portrays Noah as a loyal and courageous hero, who uses his skills and wit to help the Autobots and Maximals. Fishback portrays Elena as a smart and curious researcher, who holds the key to unlocking the secrets of the Transwarp Key, an ancient artifact that can transport anyone across time and space. The movie also explores their backgrounds and motivations, such as Noah's family issues and Elena's career aspirations.
However, the movie is not without its flaws. The movie suffers from having a predictable and clichéd plot, that relies on tropes such as the chosen one, the MacGuffin, the evil overlord, and the last-minute save. The movie also has some pacing issues, as it tries to cram too much information and action into its 127-minute runtime. The movie could have benefited from having more character development and emotional depth for both the humans and the Transformers. The movie also has some logical inconsistencies and plot holes, such as how Unicron can devour planets without being noticed by anyone else in the galaxy, how Scourge can control other Transformers with his tentacles, and how Noah can hack into Mirage's system with ease.
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a fun and entertaining movie that will appeal to fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. The movie delivers on its promise of bringing new elements to the Transformers universe, while also honoring its legacy. The movie has impressive visuals, exciting action, and likable characters that make it worth watching. However, the movie also has some flaws that prevent it from being a masterpiece. The movie could have improved on its plot, pacing, character development, and logic to make it more engaging and satisfying.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur122459646/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9105895/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-07
tt5090568;Transformers: Rise of the Beasts;AfricanBro;"The movie isn't bad it just doesn't climax as hard the every other transformers movie. The action wasn't epic and there was no glorious speech from Optimus prime that'd make me wanna do 200 pushups and fight a hyena at 3am if I had to. It's Transformers... I wanted it to make the kid in me jump, I don't care for it to be sensible. Some good reviews are probably coming from people who watched beast wars and feel nostalgia.
This has fast and furious aura to it, were family is huge incentive and that's all I could think about. Cgi and other effects are good, action was a downgrade from previous movies but still decent. The new characters were amazing, both antagonist and protagonist. Great to see what made Optimus Prime, Optimus Prime. It's not as a big a backstory as advertised, more of a midlife crisis instead. I enjoyed the new actors from other works, like Dominique fishback from project power. Anthony Ramos too. I think they're reactions to scenarios they found themselves in were believable at the start, but the chemistry they supposed to have didn't feel justified, story arc's rushed. Soundtrack pretty good(based in the 90's), the cast and the characters were great, but the story and the action let them down and are what's most unimpressive about the movie.
The first third of the movie is great, it's what you'd expect and got me a little excited, then the rest of the movie is underwhelming. A bit slow paced, not as thrilling as it should've been. Still the same DNA as other transformer movies, were humans still somehow play a really important role in alien intergalactic warfare. I think this was the weakest attempt at trying to justify humanity deserving anything more than just a participation medal for combat.
It does seem like they were trying to bring something new at first. The first act provided a good backstory, the introductions were great and some underlying racial elements. I loved that it started out like a regular movie, not transformers. Story's a bit predictable but not annoyingly so, not unless you're actively trying to figure out what's next. The bad guys in transformers are always trying to teleport another planet to earth so a little repetitive. Also takes inspiration from a lot of other stories, most notably Galactus with Scourge as silver surfer role, or Steppenwolf and Darkseid, were the evil entity sends out henchmen first.
It is open to a sequel. The ending wasn't as grand, especially the huge speech we've come to associate with the franchise. As far as the timeline is concerned, Optimus still has time to perfect his speeches and bring back linkin park.
I think the movie was lacking that wow factor, admittedly haven't seen any of the previous movies recently but they were more memorable. This has nothing for you to truly remember it by, I thought it'd be unique with a new director putting a stamp on it, but it felt like the most generic addition to the franchise yet. I think it's the most comedic but not by much and that's not what I'd want to remember a transformers movie experience by. Watching Micheal bay's takes must have been absolutely astonishing in cinema, maybe hard to match/outdo the grandeur but at least try.
Maybe knowing bumblebee and other characters survive also removes a little pathos from it as well. Bumblebee was the original rocket, then again guardians of the galaxy came out after so maybe it's the other way round.
I think it's a decent movie, especially if you had watch-along of all the transformers movies chronologically, this isn't a bad addition but it's the most forgettable. I only found out about Rise of the Beasts just before it's premiere so there wasn't really a long time for my hype to build up for this. That's probably what stopped me from being too heavily disappointed. It starts out great but everything's pretty mediocre and run-of-the-mill after that; I only enjoyed it out of my love of the franchise.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur120413622/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9111374/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-10
tt5090568;Transformers: Rise of the Beasts;TheVictoriousV;"The robots in disguise are back, although I'm not certain if we've ""truly"" seen these versions before. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a new start, of sorts. I'm assuming it takes place in the same continuity as 2018's Bumblebee, as opposed to that of Michael Bay's series -- not that those films had any kind of real, coherent continuity to begin with.
Certain fanboys have gone bananas for the film, ecstatic that it resembles the old 'toons more than it resembles the prior live-action films, but even as I try to enter the mind of a fanboy, it's hard to see what's so exciting about this dull, predictable affair. Some praised the one-take battle in one particular clip, comparing it to the shakiness, incomprehensible editing, and senseless framing of the ones in the Bay films (especially The Last Knight).
In doing so, however, they only drew attention to how bland and soulless everything looks now (not just Rise of the Beasts; that one car-chase promo for Indiana Jones 5, posted around the same time, gave us a similar epiphany). They made us miss Bay. To quote Brandon Streussnig: ""I understand Bay isn't for everyone ... but the way we've overcorrected into soulless, stitched-together one-takes where everything moves robotically (sorry) is boring. This kind of shot is in every blockbuster now and they all look the same.""
I don't know that this makes it worse than The Last Knight (very few movies are), but you can't say Bay isn't a distinct filmmaker. His compositions and color schemes are unmistakably his. His action scenes, although they failed to make these robots seem like they were actually there (they were well-rendered but never felt truly immense or heavy), had some real ""oomph"" to their gun blasts and explosions. This was in no small part due to the fact that, despite what jokes we might make about Bay's inveterate love of CGI, he did favor practical pyrotechnics, cars, and sets. (Rewatch The Rock sometime if you doubt me.)
Also, some other fans don't take kindly to the way these more cartoon-accurate designs look in live-action. (Like Bay's versions, they don't always seem to have any real presence, and without all the fire and smoke -- as well as the aforementioned shakycam -- it is easier to notice imperfections in the CGI.) So do the piles of whirring and clanking spiky garbage from the older live-action films work better? In retrospect, maybe some do. But I can't say miss watching them partake in indecipherable action scenes. Plus, none of the new robots are unnerving stereotypes, scenes/shots actually follow semi-logically from one to the next, and there aren't entire sequences devoted to explaining why dating a minor in Texas is okay, so that's nice.
All the same, I would agree that this movie feels more ""corporate""; rarely is there a sense that anyone's particular vision or voice is being expressed. But who cares? Look, it's Optimus Prime, and he's voiced again by Peter Cullen! And Optimus Primal from Beast Wars is there too, voiced by Ron Perlman! Remember Beast Wars? Oh no, Unicron is coming! Remember Unicron? Look, it's Pete Davidson as... Wait, where are you going?
In the movie, the Maximals (those are the 'bots that mimic wild animals) are the first to come under attack from Unicron (naturally, they have Something He Wants), fleeing to Earth to seek the aid of Optimus and the Autobots. Of course there must be attractive humans along for the MacGuffin hunt. They're okay, but nothing especially original; the most interesting arcs belong to the robots -- who, yes, seem like proper characters this time around.
There are some smaller-scale VFX moments that work well enough, and the 90s setting is fairly well-realized, with an appropriate number of Wu-Tang Clan and A Tribe Called Quest tracks. (I also noticed the movie Spaceballs among the assorted audio clips Bumblebee uses to communicate, which made me smile.) That's a bonus for the adults. What of the kids? Well, supposing the Spider-Verse screening is sold out, they might enjoy the action here too. For the kids-at-heart, there's the prospect that this franchise has gone full MCU and that there's apparently a full-on ""Hasbro cinematic universe"" in the works. Note that Hasbro also owns My Little Pony.
Bottom line: The movie is appreciably better than most of the previous Transformers flicks and, alas, that makes it less interesting. I can see why the cruelest critique in the Zoomer vernacular is ""mid"".";4;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19932818/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9112064/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-10

It has a wonderfully clever concept that keeps the film watchable and subversive twists that keep the experience unique.
Sadly, what keeps this movie from being powerful and memorable is it's excessive reliance on exposition. So much of it is necessary to explain the overly complex plot and possibly over half of the dialogue is clumsily-written rapid-fire exposition. It just isn't fun.
And the script keeps us from forming any sort of emotional connection with this story because it's so concerned with explaining WHAT is happening that it forgets to let us in on the intimacies of WHY it's all happening-who these people are, really, and why we should care.

tt8080204;Hypnotic;Top_Dawg_Critic;"Wow this was really bad, I mean it's worse than the worst B film I've seen, yet it has an A-list actor, and was produced, directed and co-written by seasoned filmmaker Robert Rodriguez. Affleck's acting was so bad, it felt like this was his first acting gig. Clearly Rodriguez failed in cast directing him properly, although you'd think an A-list actor wouldn't need any cast direction.
But even more sad, is how a seasoned filmmaker created such a poorly written and directed film. The writing is very sloppy, convoluted, riddled with plot holes and such nonsense, it's worthy of eyerolls and cringes. All the twists that though were being smart, were infantile logic defying nonsense. The story is a hack job with a laughably absurd and derivative narrative, executed with uninspired dialogue and wooden acting. I just couldn't buy into the premise, when this has all been done before many times, and much better.
Rodriguez's directing lacks any dramatic tension, and Affleck and Braga have zero chemistry. Even the film's score was typical B-grade film quality - overbearing, loud and constant.

Hypnotic is an interesting mystery with a cool premise. I enjoyed the story and the way it was told. I was mildly intrigued throughout. There are some really cool scenes with good visuals. And it has some compelling and creative ideas with how to use the premise.
At the same time, I wish I liked it more. Not everything works. A lot of it feels like it could have been done better. And I wasn't emotionally invested in the characters or the story. At times I felt like it should have been a streaming movie.
I still had a good time with Hypnotic and am glad I watched it. It's good for a one-time viewing. And it was cool to see Affleck and Fichtner in a movie together for the first time since Armageddon and Pearl Harbor.

Mini review of Regal Cinema's Mystery Movie Monday:
I generally don't watch trailers and try to avoid every detail about any movie I plan on watching. I would even prefer not to know the actors and director. So when I heard about this, I was immediately interested. To watch a movie without knowing the genre or even the title?!?! I had to try it. Plus it's only $5.
Of course there is a risk of it being a movie I have no interest in. I don't mind if the movie ends up being bad, as long as it's something in the general range of what I go for. I got lucky with this one. I imagine I will not be pleased if it ends up being a chick flick.
My only problem with this experience is that, right before the movie started, the director has a voice over telling us the title, director and actors. He doesn't say what it's about, but he says something like, ""get ready for the ##### and #####,"" which told me what I was in for.

Nolan likes to create extremely complex plots, with wild ideas that can alter time, space, perception, reality, memory and in this case the ability to control others thoughts thorough ESP.
It's just way to complex given the cast, locations and the overall premise. It's similar to SCANNERS from 1981.

Rodriguez did some very cool stuff in the past but this tentative of emulating Nolan is a big failure..";4;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26163020/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9057805/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-15
tt8080204;Hypnotic;JohnDeSando;"Hypnotic is a solid B movie aspiring to be Christopher Nolan's A-movie Memento or Inception with a whiff of Matrix. While it may play on notions of memory and hypnosis (see the title), it doesn't reach the nuances of Nolan's work. Yet it amuses and hints at the dangers lack of memory can cause.
For early summer and Ben Affleck in his prime (see Air), it's a safe bet for an evening that may cause you and your companions to philosophically speculate on its allegorical properties (social media mind bending, anyone?).
Danny Rourke (a perpetually glum Affleck) grieves to find his abducted daughter, Minnie (Hala Finley and Ionie Olivia Nieves), but has been searching for her for 4 years, even after arresting the kidnapper. You see, kidnapper doesn't remember a damn thing, and lo and behold more characters don't remember things either. It begins to sound like Hitchcock's Vertigo, whose re-release director Robert Rodriguez claims inspired him.
Something has a hold on their minds, a weapon far worse than guns and bombs. With the help of Detective Diana Cruz (Alice Braga), Rourke tracks from the heist to the master mind to get at the hypnosis generator. Along the way, a Hitchcock MacGuffin called Domino fades while our hero experiences a surprising facet of the titular weapon.
Although this is in no way a superhero film, it resembles one thematically with the emphasis on finding a daughter and making family whole again. That theme is more satisfactory than gaining riches or beating the hell out of bad guys.
The ending is sentimental to a fault, and the mid-credits sequence promises more of the same with a possible sequel. Summer fare could be worse, so relax in a comfy modern theater with your best bud and howl at the screen.
Hypnotic is an energetic B movie with a fleeting moment when Ben smiles. Now, that's entertainment!";4;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1391596/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9050726/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-12
tt8080204;Hypnotic;frank-liesenborgs;Robert Rodriguez weaves a mesmerizing tale, shrouded in enigma, always keeping you on the edge of your seat. The truth dances just beyond your reach, as he deftly manipulates the story like a skilled magician. Admittedly, I've seen Ben Affleck deliver more captivating performances in other films. His innate charm remains partially hidden in this endeavor. Nonetheless, it remains an enthralling watch. Affleck portrays a cop haunted by the haunting disappearance of his daughter, a mystery that has plagued him for years. However, a string of daring bank heists propels him into a clandestine world of extraordinary individuals endowed with psionic powers, individuals who may hold the key to his daughter's fate. The film's convoluted twists and turns defy expectations, defying your attempts to unravel its secrets. Alice Braga mesmerizes with her portrayal, seamlessly embodying her character's essence. While I personally relish the challenge of deciphering the intricacies of a film's plot, Braga's character defies such expectations. She elucidates the intricate details, leaving little room for speculation. The veil of mystery is lifted, revealing the truth in stark clarity. Character development takes a backseat as the narrative unfurls, for we are explicitly informed of the events as they unfold. Nevertheless, JD Pardo, as Nicks, delivers a compelling performance, leaving us yearning to witness him take the lead in future endeavors. Affleck, in his portrayal of Danny Rourke, showcases unwavering strength, anchoring the film with his solid presence. The twists and turns of the story remain delightfully elusive, avoiding the trap of predictability that often plagues such tales. In comparison to its 2021 namesake, this film shines brightly, offering a far superior experience. I sincerely recommend embarking on this mysterious journey.;7;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57396250/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9102410/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-05
tt8080204;Hypnotic;fciocca;"The first act of ""Hypnotic"" is mysterious and got me curious about what was behind Danny Rourke's daughter kidnapping. I thought that I was in for a real treat, but then unfortunately the movie loses itself. First of all, most of the dialogues have the only purpose to spoon feed the audience information about this secret government project, without letting people figure it out on their own. I get that some explanations are needed, considering that there are a few complicated elements of the story, but it almost seems that the director is treating us like children. I absolutely disliked the ending. It felt rushed, and I could not understand anything because the editing in the last thirty minutes was all over the place. They mixed scenes that were completely incoherent and the cuts are just confusing. It almost seems that they just wanted to close this project as fast as they could, without giving any extra care. I wonder if whoever worked on this movie actually watched it until the end, or if the producer signed this out for distribution after watching maybe half of the movie if not even less. The plot tries so hard to be smart, and it desperately wants to be ""Inception""; just replace the entire dream concept with mind control and you obtain conceptually the same thing. Even some visual effects are clearly the cheaper version of the famous scene set in Paris. Screenwriters should chill, this is not a Cristopher Nolan film and the writing is not nearly as good.
The acting is good for what this movie is. There are good and famous cast members, so I guess that people will go watch this just because there is Ben Affleck in it, otherwise I would probably never heard about this title. Perfectly avoidable film to be honest. I give four stars out of ten only because the intro was interesting.";4;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62460576/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9082296/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-27
tt8080204;Hypnotic;DrNectarine;"The general concept of battling hypnotics is certainly interesting, but what Hypnotic ultimately fails in is the execution of its concept.
Specifically, the movie uses hypnotic powers as a way to build plot twists, but these plot twists feel more like a half-hearted ""oh, actually that didn't happen"" than satisfying. It was equivalent to when you play a game with a child who keeps making up new rules as you go:
Adult: ""I cut your arm off with my lightsaber.""
Child: ""No you didn't! I actually healed it!""
In Hypnotic, it's much of the same, answering dramatic moments with a quick retcon that's flimsily attached to a quick ""it was hypnosis"" explanation. And like playing that game with the child, those ""plot twists"" only serve to make the Hypnotic viewing experience frustrating rather than fun.";3;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur158114624/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9050686/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-12
tt8080204;Hypnotic;darkreignn;"While watching ""Hypnotic,"" I couldn't help but notice that it lacks the essence and vision of a Robert Rodriguez film; at the same time, it also lacks the distinctive touch of any notable director. Instead, it falls into the realm of generic, direct-to-streaming movies that have flooded the market over the past decade. But all of that said, I'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy this movie, because I did.
I'm a die-hard Ben Affleck fan, so take this review with a grain of salt, because I am biased in that regard; it's always enjoyable to watch him on the big screen, and his performance in ""Hypnotic"" is no exception, even if he did look like he hated his life in the role. It's clear he's not giving it his all in this performance, but for me personally, it didn't detract from the viewing experience (and to give you another perspective, my mum, who is not a Ben Affleck fan, thought he was great in his role, so keep that in mind). Regardless, the point I am trying to make in this paragraph is that - for me - Affleck's presence immediately added entertainment value to the film; but, taking Affleck out of the equation, how does the movie stack up? Not half bad, but not all that good either - a guilty pleasure if you will.
You see, ""Hypnotic"" feels like any other straight-to-Netflix movie released during the pandemic era - the movie embraces its cheesiness with a washed-out visual style, a seemingly shoestring budget, and so called ""action sequences"" that lean more toward generic car crashes than intricately choreographed fist fights and thrilling shootouts. It's nothing particularly exciting or innovative, but all of it is wrapped around a story that did genuinely have me engaged. Being about a ""detective who investigates a mystery involving his missing daughter and a secret government program,"" (shouts out IMDb for the synopsis), ""Hypnotic"" is - at first - like nothing that you haven't already seen. However, as the film progresses, I have to admit that the movie took me by surprise, going places that I genuinely didn't expect, leading to a second half and a final act that had me legitimately intrigued, if not riveted.
I'm finding this an increasingly hard movie to review, because while I wouldn't recommend it and wouldn't say that it's good, something about it struck some type of chord with me; ""Hypnotic"" doesn't work as an action movie, and it doesn't work as a drama, but it does work as a B-movie science-fiction mystery that has enough entertainment value through its twists and turns to keep you guessing. By no means a theatre experience, if you're going to watch this, watch it at home with some friends and a couple of beers - no doubt the ideal viewing method. This is a ridiculous one, but it's one that you can definitely have some fun with as long as you temper your expectations and realize that, while this isn't a good film, it is an entertaining one.";6;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33659536/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9051939/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-13
tt8080204;Hypnotic;moviemanmo;"The concept was interesting but it all seemed very rushed. The ideas were introduced but they were not explored very much. It seems the film maker was contempt with keeping this film very simple perhaps afraid of getting too complex. Personally I wanted to see more of these ""Hypnotics"" at work or know how they came to be. Before we could question what was going on we were given the answer and this took away from the mystery aspect of the film. This didn't feel like a mystery it felt more of a drama with a small mystery element.
This movie could have benefited from more special effects especially since it dealt with people's perception and mind control. Even a bit more action would have been nice.
The reveal and explanation for what was going on was just okay. It was cool but it didn't blow me away. Some of the acting could have been better. The characters and their relationships could have been stronger.

tt8080204;Hypnotic;waltermwilliams;"""Hypnotic"" is a family affair with director Robert Rodriguez surrounded by his offspring on this project.
Racer Max (co-writer, producer), Rebel (composer), Sid (SFX), Rhiannon (storyboards) and Rocket (who is neither a Racoon nor Trash Panda...""Guardians"" fans will get this) in the Edit Suite.
This script has been 20 years in production.
Although it's hardly an original plot or title.
In 2021, Kate Siegel starred in a movie also called, ""Hypnotic"", then there was ""Hypnotica"" just last year, ""The Hypnotic Eye"" in 1960 and many more.
What is the fascination with hypnotism that makes it so sexy for Hollyweird to feed off this same trough?
As Robert knows control is an illusion and the Rodriguez family were famously under the illusion they were in control of this runaway train wreck.
Essentially it's an ""Inception"" wannabe.
On the surface ""Hypnotic"" is about a detective who investigates a bank robbery plus an intertwined mystery involving the cops missing daughter and a secret government program.
Ben Affleck is the detective ""Danny Rourke"" and his target is ""Dellrayne"" William Fichtner.
Watch out for: ol' blue eyes Jeff Fahey as ""Carl"" and Jackie Earl Haley as ""Jeremiah"".
Apparently there is an after end credit scene, but I couldn't be bothered waiting and left as soon as the credits started rolling.
It's gets two stars from me for Ben Affleck and Robert Rodriguez both of whom should have known better.
Meantime Rodriguez better go back to his own playbook ""Rebel Without A Crew"" to get his wonderful career back on track.

The movie had an interesting concept, that perhaps could have been cool if it would have been presented differently. The main thing that brings this movie down is the script.

tt0439572;The Flash;chand-suhas;"Finally after the early screening on 6th June which showed the unfinished print, I get to watch the final cut on IMAX today. One major drawback is that a movie this big has both really good and really bad VFX. Apart from that, this complete fan service aims at not taking the story forward into the DCEU's newly planned future, instead takes Barry Allen on his usual time travel to save his mom and him learning the repercussions of his action, the hard way.
This harmless PG-13 movie sticks to the basics and plays safe to the core. Adds a bunch of cameos from DC universe to get us fans riled up. The narrative ranges from meh to ""oh that's fun"" and the director Andy Muschietti hardly fails in hitting the mark. He clearly knows what he intends to do with this script and plays to it's strengths. Ezra Miller indeed is good as The Flash is an added advantage and rest Michael Keaton's return as Batman takes care off.
Special mention to all the cameos as they simply were that good. Needless to say, the film is worth watching for them. Sasha Calle's Supergirl has very little to do and she tries to make most of what is offered to her. The visuals during the time travel and the reveal of multiverse was well done. The humor ensures to lighten the tone while keeping the mother-son sentiment intact.

OK. So it does not live up to the positive buzz from the early screenings. It's nowhere near being one of the best comic book movies of all time. It's not even in the conversation for being one of the best DC movies. But I did have a lot of fun with it.
A lot may depend on your feelings of Ezra Miller. Younger Barry Allen was really annoying, but I think that's the point. I had no issues with them in the role.
The stand out for me, was Michael Keaton. When Batman is doing his things and Danny Elfman's iconic score is booming, it's a joy. But make no mistake this is not Batman 3, it's a Flash movie that features Keaton's Batman.
Supergirl was good, I enjoyed her, and if she gets a stand alone, I'd watch it. There were some surprises, that I'm amazed have not leaked.
It feels it's run time at times and some of the CGI is very dodgy, especially during a certain moment. Considering what they were going for, I can't believe they released it like that. The CGI at that moment is my biggest complaint.

tt0439572;The Flash;Holt344;"The Flash has finally arrived, a film I've been looking forward to since it came to fruition back in 2019 after many years in development of different directors/writers. Flashpoint would be the inspiration behind the film and that got me excited as I love the graphic novel, this isn't a direct adaption, its inspired and has Barry Allen traveling back in time to save his mother as the plot point but after that, everything is different and honestly it works quite well in how you'll be in for a ride that you'll be unprepared for like The Flash in the film. Ezra Miller has been a topic of controversy for two years and I understand why someone would choose not to watch it for him but his performance is great in this and he's better than ever as The Flash. Then came the marketing, making Michael Keaton the main Batman with him reappearing as his character from Tim Burton's two Batman films, Sasha Calle as Supergirl and the first trailer brought back Michael Shannon as General Zod and Antje Traue as Faora-Ul which was the villains for ""Man of Steel"" which was the start of the DCEU, it feels fitting that they're back for the ending (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom will be the true conclusion). It also stars Ron Livingston, Maribel Verdú and Kiersey Clemons. With Ben Affleck along with other actors from the DCEU making cameos.
Barry Allen uses his super speed to change the past, but his attempt to save his family creates a world without super heroes, forcing him to race for his life in order to save the future.
The Flash is directed by Andy Muschietti from a screenplay by Christina Hodson, she wrote Birds of Prey prior to this so she has knowledge of the universe. Henry Braham served as a cinematographer for the film and shot The Suicide Squad prior to this aswell for the last two volumes of Guardians of the Galaxy. Benjamin Wallfisch did the musical score for the film and it's a good soundtrack, music fitting each scene both light hearted and darker, also the more suspenseful scenes. I think it was nicely edited. Andy Muschietti's direction was great, I really liked his vision for the project and how he wanted to make the project his own and fitting to the DCEU. I don't have any criticism towards him, great visual storytelling and it felt like he gave great direction to the actors.
The Flash met my expectations, it was a great superhero film which brought plenty of satisfying and joyful moments. I love the characters and DCEU, I think they did a good job at putting an ending to it. With the speed force and time traveling, we got the multiverse in film format (after seeing it in Arrowverse and Titans before), and I don't want to spoil anything but you'll surely find it worth sitting through. The Flash offers a lot of things to like, the visual effects could and should have been better though, the final battle sequence against General Zod deserved ten times better effects and a more detailed location. I also understand why Michael Shannon didn't quite like it in this film just because of how one-dimensional Zod is and how there are almost no deep themes, I wouldn't say there are no themes though as there's one strong theme that's executed perfectly on screen and in writing, the theme of loss. There was emotional depth in the film through the loss of Nora, Barry's mother, it was executed perfectly and performed perfectly by Ezra Miller. The writing offered some great comedy, plenty of laughs from me and the others in the audience on the premiere, Ezra Miller had that comedic timing. Overall, I think the writing was great, much better than her work on Birds of Prey. The dialogue was great and so was the characterization. I really enjoyed the first and second act, they were golden. The third was fine but could have been better. The action sequences were great, all of them! Again, here the visual effects could have been better, but the action sequences were well thought out. It was also nice to see Michael Keaton back as Batman, he was great! I also liked Sasha Calle as Supergirl, good performance. This is a film I'll rewatch, without a doubt.

tt0439572;The Flash;drawlife;"So after being in development for years, multiple re-writes and director changes, the drama behind the film's star and with the current DC shakeup THE FLASH somehow still manages to be an okay comic-book film.
You would think with all the change ups between the writers and the directors there would be some inconsistency within the film, but for the most part there wasn't. Now the hype train dubbed this as one of the greatest superhero/comic-book films ever made, and it really does not reach those heights, but it is a good entertaining film with some depth and layers.
Putting aside all the Ezra Miller wrongdoings, they are very good in the film. Miller's performance in the theatrical cut of JUSTICE LEAGUE to me came off as a buffoon who made lame jokes about brunch. ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE however, that performance was more akin to what I wanted as a comic-book fan who's read Flash comics. Miller plays two versions of Barry, one older who shows more maturity and experience and one as a young teen, who is a more immature version of himself. There is a nice balance between both performances, but I will admit young Barry's antics and jokes kinda did get annoying after a while.
Maribel Verdu's Nora Allen serves as Barry's motive to go back in time to save his mother. She has some good tender moments at the end when Barry does realize he needs to let her death play out. Ron Livingston replaces Billy Crudup and does a good job with the scenes he had.
I've been on record saying Ben Affleck is my favorite Batman because I loved his brutality, his rage, and his merciless attitude. To me a Jim Lee drawing come to life. He's only in it in the beginning of the film where an incredibly fun action set piece takes place. If this is the last time I'll see him (which it probably will be) as the character then I'm happy I got to see him just once more.
Michael Keaton definitely brought back the nostalgia. In his old age he hasn't lost a step and has a solid role within the film. Anything with him is basically fan-service on overdrive, especially the Elfman Batman score and his memorable lines from the 89 BATMAN film. Since it is the mutliverse keep an eye out for some cameos near the climax. Sasha Calle steps into the role of Supergirl and I didn't mind her presence or performance but she was just kinda there. She plays an important part, but it never marinated enough for it to feel any true weight, but to mainly be there to serve the action at the end. She does have a nice fight with Michael Shannon's Zod.
Piggybacking off that, I really did like how director Andy Muschietti honored what came before with what Zack Snyder did. He didn't blatantly ignore it which I appreciated. So even if seeing Affleck, Shannon, and some other familiar Snyder-Verse cast members for just a quick bit, it was nice that there was an acknowledgment of what came before.
Now the VFX are very questionable. I know Muschietti said that the VFX was meant to look weird on purpose and I get his reasoning behind it, but it just looked way too wonky. Distractingly wonky that it took me out of the film from time to time.
As for the future of DC, that's all up in the air, it feels. Original set photos showed Supergirl and Keaton's Batman showing up at the end, but that has changed. Anything can happen now, and we'll see whether that's a good thing in time.
To sum it up, THE FLASH is an overhyped film that just happens to be a good/entertaining spectacle with a narrative that isn't exactly new, but the nuances give it that extra flare that prevents it from being a total nostalgia bait/fan service.

tt0439572;The Flash;kjproulx;"When Justice League hit theatres in 2017, I'll admit that Ezra Miller's rendition of The Flash wasn't my favourite, but his version grew on me over the years. The DC films in the last ten years have been hit or miss though. You could never tell if a film was going to be good or not. Well, hearing everything that could happen in DC's latest release, The Flash, I had to see it for myself. I'm happy to report that after seeing it and sitting on my thoughts for a couple of days, I can confidently say that this is one of DC's better films in the last 5-10 years and the emotional core packs a great punch.
Having lost his mom in the past, Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) decides to use his super speed to run back in time to prevent her death and prevent his father from being wrongfully accused of her murder. In doing so, he ends up in another reality where he meets another version of himself, another version of Batman, and another version of an alien from Krypton. Also returning is the villain Zod, from the film Man of Steel. This was a fun ride to take and the action is great, but the storyline involving his mom is what worked the most for me and brought me to tears by the end. If for nothing else, the writers cared very much about the mother-son relationship.
Everyone seems to be talking about how awful the CGI is as well, but I personally found certain sequences were meant to feel like an animation instead of looking realistic. Maybe that's just me, but I was able to forgive most of the effects because I felt that way. Still, I do agree some more polishing may have been needed. Still, the CGI did not take me out of the movie as some critics have been stating. In fact, without giving anything away, certain elements needed CGI that could only be done so well in the first place, so I gave them a bit of a pass. The furthest thing to think about when talking about this film is the visual effects though, so let's move on.
I must say, yes it was cool to see Michael Keaton with the cape and cowl once again, but with all the cameos sprinkled throughout this film, I am starting to think I'll miss this world a bit as they get moving in another direction with DC. Although funny, this film felt most like Man of Steel in terms of care and effort being put into the story and tone. This film set out to be an emotional story before being a fan service fest, which I appreciated. All the cameos throughout the film just felt like the icing on the cake.
The Flash is a film that I pretty much had no expectations for so I am surprised how much I enjoyed it. Ezra Miller carries this film with a very solid performance, Andy Muschietti delivered as director, and Christina Hodson and Joby Harold truly wrote a compelling story arc for Barry Allen. Does the film get a little much by the end and overstay its welcome in terms of bombastic visuals? Maybe, but if I'm going to nitpick that, then I have a lot of things to nitpick as well, but none of them really bothered me. I was here for a good time and I got a little more than just that, which put a big old smile on my face. If you're thinking you're interested at all based on what you've seen so far, I think you'll like this one. I recommend it.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9132860/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-19
tt0439572;The Flash;MatthewMichaelHoffman;"SCORE: 8.4/10
This was the ultimate DC fan movie. Watching this made me really sad to know that the DCEU is coming to close because it really did have a ton of potential. But, when Zach Snyder completely botches the introductions to the 2 most important characters, Superman and Batman, there is no surprise that they couldn't recover from that catastrophic mistake. Instead, I'm glad that they are going out with a bang. The Flash is one of the most ambitious films I've seen in a while. The story follows Flash as he travels back in time to save his mother, but by doing so gets a harsh lesson in the ways of the multiverse. Although it does share a lot of similarities to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, it still does add its own unique flavor instead of copying it verbatim.
I've always really liked Flash as a character in the DCEU. Certainly not the Actor that plays him, but the character was always a highlight in a lot of other DCEU projects. The comedy was not as pendulum swinging between good and bad as something like Thor: Love and Thunder, but it did have its fair share of jokes that didn't land incredibly well. The rest of it was hilarious and I loved watching the two version of Barry interact with each other and show the duality of his personality. I found myself being able to connect emotionally with some of the scenes, but there was something inherently holding me back from connecting fully. I thought I would've been more emotional with the scenes between Barry and his mother, especially with the final scene where he has to say goodbye to her at the grocery store, but maybe the comedic nature of the film overshadows the biggest emotional moments of the movie. Well, at least for me.
The trailers leading up to this project revealed way too much. I'm sure they felt the need to advertise with Michael Keaton's Batman in order to salvage the feeling people had towards the movie after Ezra Miller's criminal escapade, but it definitely takes away from the viewing experience of his character. With that said, the scenes he was in were fantastic and he adds a ton of value to the story. However, I feel like they did Supergirl's character an injustice. Her impact just wasn't felt as much as it should've. The fight scenes were cinematically beautiful and there is no denying the stunning audio and visuals DC has been known for. Also, the pop culture references were top tier.
I saved the best for last. Anyone who watches this movie knows why I hold it in a higher regard than most of the comments I've made in this review so far. When dealing with a movie that involves the multiverse, you can imagine how it would open the opportunity for some pretty insane cameos and moments for longtime fans of DC. At this point, with any DC movie, it is a guarantee that you are going to get a Gal Gadot Wonder Woman cameo that lasts all of 2 minutes, which I am certainty not complaining about. The rest of the Justice League does get a lot of references during Barry's journey across the multiverse, but that initial interaction between Barry, Bruce, and Wonder Woman is hilarious and sets the tone for the rest of the movie. That damn Lasso of Truth. The rest of the big reveals come later on during the film's final act, where all of the universes begin to collide with one another. This was when peak excitement set in for what was to be revealed.
As a casual fan of DC, meaning someone who hasn't read the comics and doesn't know every single minor character variation, one cameo particularly blew my socks off and had me smiling from ear to ear. That was Christopher Reeve's Superman. I like that they did have a little bit for each generation of DC fan, capping it off with the appearance of a Nicolas Cage's Superman. We weren't allowed to have our phones on during the sneak preview, so I had asked the guy sitting next to me about the significance of that character and if he had ever actually played Superman before, as I don't remember ever seeing him. He filled me in on the backstory behind everything and in that moment I had just felt the impact of what they did with this movie. It truly was the perfect movie for a DC fan.
This last part needs its own section. The ONLY thing holding this back from being a 4.5 (9 on IMDB) instead of a 4 (8 on IMDB) is the absence of anything to do with Christian Bale's Batman. I don't know if that was a Christian Bale ego thing or something completely different, but there was a Christopher Nolan sized hole in this movie. I was fully expecting Barry to run into him in the ally during the post credit scene with Aquaman, but it ended up just being mid. I really got my hopes up when I saw a different Bruce Wayne step out of the car, only to find out it was George Clooney, which I thought was pretty funny. The last thing I will say about the film is that, just like some of the humor, a lot of the cameos and lines from the classic characters felt a bit forced and out of place for the sake of being a reference rather than an organic fit. Best DC movie since The Dark Knight? Absolutely not. Enjoyable film that I will be seeing for a second time?

tt0439572;The Flash;jtindahouse;"I always start any review of a superhero movie by making it clear that these are not my types of movies and my opinion, for any superfans out there, should always be taken with a grain of salt. Now with that in mind, I have to say 'The Flash' is about as much as I can enjoy one of these types of movies. This was a very fun ride I'm happy to admit.
The movie is basically fan-service on overdrive. Anything a mega-fan has always wanted to see is likely going to show up at some stage in this movie. If that's your kind of thing then you are going to be in heaven.
I found the pacing good. The movie is just short of 2 and a half hours but that time goes by pretty quickly. As usual in these types of superhero movies I found the final battle scene the weakest the film had to offer. It got messy and convoluted and it was really the one part of the movie where I lost interest.
Of all the superhero movies I've seen this is probably the one least focused on the villain. He really does feel like an after-thought more than anything. The movie is far more about Barry Allen and his mission. Which makes it surprising to me just how much I enjoyed the film, because the one thing I do often get out of these films is enjoyment from the villain.
I think people are going to have a good time with this one. It doesn't feel like the usual copy and paste template that the MCU has been throwing out for 15 years now and it is certainly a step up from everything non-Batman that DC has been doing recently. I really enjoyed this. 8/10.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3793011/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9119993/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-14
tt0439572;The Flash;Drawmort;"Finally, The Flash. After all the silenced controversy of its protagonist, one of the most promising films of the last stage of DC comes to light. The film was quite promising, and on balance... it falls short. Join me to find out why without stripping a single spoiler.
Let's start from the essential: the script. The story is basic to be a contemporary superhero movie. It contains humor, which feels excessive in the middle of the film. It has a lot of action, from the very beginning of the footage, which is appreciated. But eventually we get to the topic of fashion. On a personal and subjective note, I'm already sick of the multiverse. At least be original and rename the concept! The next movie that dares to close down and make fun of this concept will have my wholehearted support. Anyway, this applies to using time travel of course, and showing a couple of rather impressive cameos.
The direction is quite interesting. It has very daring use of angles and lenses that work very well with the story. The photography is effective and the edition is quite precise. The soundtrack is one of the great elements of the film that knows how to deal with nostalgia, but at times it feels too patchy. The acting is decent, as is the costume design.
The controversial element of this film is undoubtedly the visual effects. Surely the effects are present in almost the whole movie and almost half of them are pretty bad. The human figure has no real references neither in movements nor in logical details. I have seen video games from outdated consoles with a better visuals than The Flash.
Anyway. The Flash is a basic, action-packed movie that tries to be fun and emotional but fails too much in VFX, an element that its target audience is unforgiving in the year 2023.
I end by saying that if Muschietti had come even a little closer to The Flashpoint Paradox, this movie would have been a masterpiece.";6;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44965663/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9123703/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-16
tt0439572;The Flash;Jeremy_Urquhart;"The Flash is a junk food movie, but sometimes junk food hits the spot. I think in this case, it kind of did, and I had fun. There are problems here for sure, and maybe it'll all fall apart in my mind the more I think about it. But I had a pretty good time with this, and while it might not have been as filling or satisfying as a proper piece of cínèmá, I feel like as far as unapologetic crowd-pleasers go, this is one of the better ones.
It has fun with a time travel plot, and also dives right into all that multiverse stuff that's all the rage at this point. We may be at a breaking point soon with movies that spiral off into different universes/timelines, in the process bringing back actors to roles they haven't occupied for years or even decades, but I know I still get some enjoyment out of this kind of thing. In a couple of years, who knows - there's a good chance fatigue will set in around this latest trend, but unlike a lot of cinematic trends/sub-genres, this one has at least inspired universally loved movies and even Oscar winners (like Into the Spider-Verse and of course Everything Everywhere All At Once).
The Flash is a movie that's desperate for you to like it, and I can see that turning some people off. But others are probably going to like it a lot, and I imagine it'll do well at the box office. As for the future of DC, that's all up in the air, it feels. Anything can happen now, and we'll see whether that's a good thing in time. I'm also interested to see how fans of previous DC movies react to this, given how divided the fanbase is (and how fractured all the different DC universes are, what with the extra worlds of Robert Pattinson's Batman and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker).
But The Flash? It's fun. It's entertaining. It panders sometimes. It looks a bit like a video game at points (also plays out like one at times). Its humour generally lands, but not always. I'll probably never watch it again, but I had a good time watching it just this once.";7;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26226712/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9119922/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-14
tt0439572;The Flash;cricketbat;The Flash is a goofy movie. Not only is it much lighter in tone than most of the DC Extended Universe, but it's also wildly uneven, unsuccessfully trying to balance dramatic moments with constant attempts at lowbrow humor. The computer graphics are shockingly bad and are, at times, reminiscent of 2004's The Polar Express. There are some genuinely dramatic parts, when Ezra Miller isn't mugging for the camera, and I'd be lying if I said my childhood heart didn't surge with joy almost every time a Tim Burton's Batman reference was made, but The Flash was, for the most part, a disappointing fizzle.;5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6201371/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9120015/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-14
tt0439572;The Flash;kuner-59029;"So here it is, the end to the high concept, but ultimately failed DCEU cinematic universe, resetting the timeline for a new cinematic universe, which will undoubtedly be much worse.
In a brilliant move, the marking centered on Michael Keaton's Batman. Up until the final 45 minutes, the film is an absolute mess, with Ezra Miller overacting, trying his best to do the wide eyed clumsy-fasttalking-annoyingly-likeable thing that Tom Holland does. In some scenes he succeeds, in others he misses the beat. The film meanders until Keaton's Batman shows up. Once he does, he takes over the movie. He's in a completely different league from the rest of the cast, and still absolutely mesmerizing on screen.
Seeing his performance made me realize what a damn tragedy it was that Warner messed up the Batman IP this badly over the years. We could have had decades of Keaton as Batman, taking on a rogue gallery of interesting villains in Burton's wonderful gothic nightmare city. While Nolan's Dark Knight films were fantastic, Keaton just embodied Batman like no one else.
Instead, they wasted time and money on the awful Schumacher films with Kilmer and Clooney (who's cameo here is actually fun), Snyder's failed take on Batman and the watchable but sterile and unnecessary recent series with Robert Pattinson. Warner were sitting on pure cinematic, iconographic gold and didn't realize it.
As you might expect, the Flash descends into a giant CGI mess towards the end. It's bad, but at least there are some stakes.
The movie is full of cameos, but they amount to little more than a trailer reel for past DC movies going all the way back to George Reeves. Nicholas Cage is in it as Superman, which was a brilliant little nod to those who know of that failed project.
The CGI has been criticized a lot. Indeed, it's terrible, but it didn't hinder my enjoyment of the film. The characters here are almost all fun and interesting. The one weak point, unfortunately, is Ezra Miller's Flash. Which is a bit of a problem, when he's your main character(s).
Alas, Synder's high concept cinematic universe comes to a close now, and instead we will get misanthropic garbage from James Gunn, which will undermine every remotely emotional moment with a joke, be filled with popsongs, random family guy style humor, and probably fail within 5 years.
Good job Warner.";6;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur59761418/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9129003/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-17
tt0439572;The Flash;TheVictoriousV;"The Flash is a very stupid, very awkward, even occasionally contemptible film. It is also fascinating, mainly in terms of its production history and Warner Bros.'s unyielding devotion to getting it out, even in the face of lead actor Ezra Miller's expanding list of criminal offenses (you'll recall that other DC projects have been scrapped for far less). Notably, a Flash picture has been in development since the Christopher Reeve days (you can even sort of tell which scene was written at which point in comic-book movie history and which popular trend DC was trying to copy at that time), but the desperation to finally give this comic-book icon his own cinematic feature isn't the whole story:
This is supposed to be the great reset, where The Flash goes back in time and supposedly creates a new version of the DC Extended Universe where, I dunno, things are consistent, build patiently, and follow an actual plan. In a sense, DC needed this film and Flash's reality-warping abilities.
It's likely that Miller's criminal history is the reason why they also revealed -- and emphasized -- early on that we were really getting a crossover film (or ""crossover event"" as aficionados would say); a DC equivalent to Spider-Man: No Way Home that unites several of our old ""favorites"", chief among them the Batman of the Burtonverse. Yes, just like NWH brought back Maguire and Garfield for a final hurrah, Michael Keaton now reprises his version of the Caped Crusader one last (?) time. Between this and his barely-tacked-on-yet-heavily-marketed Vulture cameo in Morbius last year, I haven't decided if Birdman (2014) has become funnier or more depressing.
At least fanboys aren't denying the Marvelism of the DCEU as they've done in the past. Instead, they seem painfully aware, starting up Twitter campaigns to fire James Gunn (the Marvel regular who, following a fairly successful attempt at winning over DC-skeptics with Peacemaker and The Suicide Squad, is set to ""lead"" whichever new DC-verse was created by this film), or sell the Snyderverse to Netflix, as per the hashtag #SellTheSnyderverseToNetflix, whatever they think that means. (At this point, I'm tempted to agree that Snyder's version would have at least been more interesting than all this mess, had he gotten to see it through, but you're kidding yourself if you think we're going to see more of it than what The Snyder Cut teased any time soon.)
In the film, Barry Allen (Miller) uses his ""speed force"" abilities to do the verboten and go back through time to undo the death of his mother -- which his universe's Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck), while knowing what he's going through, advises against. In doing so, however, Barry predictably mucks up the timeline and winds up a very different reality, specifically a very different 2013. And so we don't just get Keaton's Bruce and an alternate Barry Allen (which, for what it's worth, leads to some funny moments and some well-done doppelgänger effects), but also a version of the events in Man of Steel where the starfleet of General Zod (Michael Shannon) instead battles Supergirl (Sasha Calle), whose action figure is in stores now!
So, no, we never actually return to the Burtonverse proper; instead, Barry's voyage through time created an alternate timeline where Bruce Wayne was born earlier and looks like Keaton, a different Kryptonian than Kal-El was sent to Earth, the other heroes never came to be, and most importantly, Eric Stoltz evidently played Marty in Back to the Future. So by ""alternate timeline"", I mean that Barry's journey to the past changed not just the timeline going forward, but the future and the past alike. (Bat-Keaton explains it to the two Barrys using strains of spaghetti at one point. Ha ha, tee hee.) Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe we are to understand that the timeline Barry creates is that of the Burton films, that this bumbling Bat-Keaton is somehow the one we all know, and that Pfeiffer's Catwoman is still out there somewhere.
We get a fair number of soulless, inconsequential, over-the-top action scenes -- some of which look like video games; others that look so shoddy and incomplete that they seem like experiments to test just how ugly this stuff can get before Twitter stans stop simping for it. They even placed the horizon in the very center of the frame at several points during the battle with Zod, something clearly only Wes Anderson is allowed to do.
In addition to the aforementioned cameos, there are a few I won't reveal here, although I will tell you that digital reanimation of dead celebrities à la Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is involved, only it looks even worse now -- ""like Madame Tussaud's wax figures laid over audio-animatronic puppets"", to quote Matt Zoller Seitz. These crossover moments typify fanservice key-jangling at its absolute worst; don't expect the same thematic and narrative purpose as in Across the Spider-Verse, nor the same seamlessness. The pieces are just sort of shoved together, never mind the fact that Keaton's Batsuit was clearly designed for darker, more atmospheric images (something that the canceled Batgirl film, also starring Keaton, seemed to get right) or that his Bat-wing absolutely could not go up against/outrun Kryptonian warships as seen in Snyder's film.
I'm going to paraphrase someone else's hot take here: Remember when people complained about Ready Player One and how they didn't invent any new pop culture for its futuristic setting, as if new things stopped being created around the 2010s and people kept obsessing over the same stuff forever? Given that, in the year of our lord 2023, Keaton is still/once again Batman and Ford is still/once again Indiana Jones, can you honestly blame Ready Player One for thinking that?
Granted, I believe better times are ahead, even if the films we get out of Hollywood won't strictly be original. Still, when Quantumania loses out to Mario, the signs are clear. Theaters are back with a vengeance -- restriction-less and, in my hometown's case, with better seating than ever -- and their stats speak plainly on the matter of MCU-style franchise films. Yes, we loved Guardians 3 (leave it to James Gunn to rescue every franchise under the sun) so it ain't over till it's over, but if you ask my opinion: Let the comic-book heroes rest, especially poor old Bat-Keaton and double-especially those who are actually dead IRL.";2;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19932818/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9125536/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-16
tt0439572;The Flash;timcain81;"I really didn't know what to make of this.. I was surprised by the tone, it is much less darker than the other DCEU movies and is tonally similar to Wonder Woman 1984.
The opening scene for me rang alarm bells.. the CGI is absolutely laughable with utterly ridiculous scenes bordering of complete silliness. Superman 3 comes to mind. It literally features the worst CGI I have seen in a long time, it felt like I was watching an animated cartoon.
The tone then shifts to darker territory briefly when the plot moves along, before suddenly jolting you back to the lighter silliness.
Ezra Miller does an ok job in the titular role. He seems to be having fun with the character as does Michael Keaton, who steals the scenes when he finally appears on screen.
There are many clever cameos throughout, however brief some may be and it feels like a nice homage to the DC movies of yesteryear.
Overall, yeah the CGI was terrible and it tries hard and fails to deliver what Spiderman NWH did much better, but it's a fun ride nevertheless and I did enjoy it.";6;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur48884554/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9123859/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-16
tt0439572;The Flash;quiqueperezsoler;"I am not exaggerating when I say this is one of the best DC movies so far. It perfectly adapts the source material to the current characters of the Snyderverse and bridges the gap between the old and the new DC universe that began with a more colorful and characteer-driven Aquaman and Wonder Woman movies (in spite of the flaws these may have).
The screenplay in this movie, that is the story and character arcs, is absolutely gold. It is witty, funny and splendidly well-rounded. All the jokes land perfectly and it is all thanks to the great performance of Ezra Miller, which would be more acclaimed if it weren't for the bad reputation that preceeds him.
And perhaps a bit surprisingly, every other character introduced and ""returning"" do a fantastic performance, elevated by their characterization. Audiences should be really satisfied with the directions they took every main character in this film.
I don't want to get into spoilers so I will just mention that the costume and set design is incredibly imaginative. The story is inspired by a famous Flash comicbook but it is modified enough to be more relevant to the current iteration of the Flash while maintaining the core messages and themes. And in some aspects, actually improve the story itself. All amounting to a climax where the emotional payoff is earned.
It is obvious the care and effort that was put into this movie in almost all aspects except one. One that seems to be the weaker link in all DC movies: the subpar CGI. I don't doubt the talents of the CGI artists at Warner Bros, but there's something happening behind close doors. Either time constraints (which seems unlikely given DC doesn't pump out as much content as Marvel), lack of workforce or simply budget constraints? (again, highly unlikely given the budgets these movies have). It's unfortunate because it is subpar enough to break the illusion (is very noticeable when you see shots of Flash's costume switching from CGI to physical costume on a close-up). But is imaginative enough to be overlooked.
And again, the heavy lifting is done by the story and characterisation, which is stellar. Add there the performances and visually stunning action set pieces and you have great entertainment. The relationships between the characters is well defined and come full circle in the end, I applaud the use of every character and their comic book iteration and I thank the good and restraint use of the easter eggs and references which the nature and trailer of this movie clearly disclosed there would be (so that wasn't really a spoiler)
All in all, this is a great direction to take DC on and in some ways, this movie feels kind of James Gunn-y: the characters are compelling, some wacky and hilarious, others more subdued but also witty; the relantionships between them are earned and emotionally satisfying and the story is character driven; and things like the editing and music-heavy montage scenes (not saying they are uniquely Gunn, but they reminisce of GUnn). And most importantly: the movie has something compelling to say. Which may sound obvious, but a lot of superhero movies lately have lost track of it. Surely they are visually stunning and action driven, but we can't forget the characters and their flaws and strengths, and exploring both is always a great idea! So more, please, more of this quality of DC.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80500138/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9120115/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-14

Conceptually it's a knockout film. Dealing with love and loss ... and time travel (you know, the important stuff). But the script and execution seemed a bit, dare I say it rushed.
If I were to wax lyrical, which I will, might I say that there's one key lesson to be learned from the theme of this movie that perhaps wasn't followed by its makers?
It's no spoiler to note that the idea of going back in time to adjust the past and thereby repair the present is a sweet temptation. But when we remove that limitation of linear time, binding us to our past mistakes, trouble seems to stem out in all directions. OK, so my analogy is that by relying heavily on CGI to theoretically create anything that one's imagination can conceive, the temptation is to consciously turn everything up to 10 (or 11 if you're in Spinal Tap) and conjure up endlessly amazing experiences. But we're linear beings, for the most part. We need common reference points to know where and who we are. Otherwise, we go off the rails.
That's what I felt was absent from the The Flash movie. Too much of what could be but not enough of what is. We're left disoriented and, ultimately, a bit disengaged.
If I were to go back in time and change something I would have spent more time focusing on the drama of having two Barrys in existence - excellent FX work and acting here.

The Flash is pure fan service for the sake of fan service, and it's not even good fan service. All of it just serves as a distraction, and poor excuse for terrible writing, terrible storytelling, and atrocious pacing.
When this movie starts, you better brace yourself because it doesn't stop! Maybe this is intentional? Maybe it's supposed to be fast and chaotic as to give audience members a feel for Barry's life. But that can't be because any sane person can see that is the poorest form of storytelling. This film jumps from scene to scene with no cohesive thought or balance. They took a collection of scenes and let a monkey edit everything together.
The only time, the only time this movie actually stopped, and showed some sense was in its conclusion. Barry finally stopping and seeing the chaos and destruction he had caused in the multiverse, but because everything beforehand was set up so poorly that it just didn't matter anymore. Then that ending just threw whatever good was in that sequence away in the dumpster.
Now, NOT everything here is bad. The best this film has going for it are the performances. Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman was great. I was very happy to see him one last time as the caped crusader. Michael Keaton's return was also great, though the explanation of why he was the way he was during his introduction was so weak. Ezra Miller (despite the trash human being, he may be) still does a great job as the Flash/Barry Allen. Michael Shannon's return of General Zod while great was just why? He was absolutely inconsequential in this film. Literally, any villain could've been in Zod's place. But I suppose it could be perceived that the real villain of this film was Barry himself, I guess. Lastly Sasha Calle, I enjoyed her immensely in her small role as Supergirl/Kara I don't know if they have decided to have a Supergirl in the future of the DCEU, but I will be more than ok to see her reprise this role. Also, all the good moments this film had were in the trailers.
There are other issues I have with this film, such as the CGI. While it wasn't poor, I hated the style. It looked so fake and cartoony it just clashed with everything else in the film. During the opening sequence at the hospital the babies literally looked like dolls. It was hideous it bordered on uncanny valley levels of bad. My friend laughed at it continuously, and I'm pretty sure that sequence wasn't meant to be funny, or at least if it was, I didn't find it funny. Which will lead me into another issue, comedy. Nothing was funny here. All the jokes were so poor and ill placed. I couldn't tell when the movie was serious or if it was supposed to be joking. The audience I was with barely laughed either.
Then there's the run time. I felt the entire 2 hours and 24 minutes, and for a movie that was so fast-paced, it was incredibly slow. In the middle of the movie, I looked at my phone to see only 1 hour passed. I couldn't believe I had another hour and 20 minutes to go.
Uh, what else... there's a post credit-scene that's used for comedic purposes but was unfunny and a waste of time to sit and wait for.
Overall I can't recommend watching this atrocious poor excuse of a DC film but if you like fan service for nothing more for the sake of well fan service and can turn your brain off to literally everything else then I'm sure you can have a good time.
I don't know how my fellow audience members felt about this movie but I'm almost 100% sure I heard one individual say ""this sucked"" as he walked out so maybe I'm not alone just in a vast minority.

tt0439572;The Flash;moviemanmo;"While this movie is entertaining it doesn't introduce any new ideas. It basically rides the trend of every superhero movie that has come out in the past year. They all have a story that deals with time and multiple timelines. This movie unfortunately was released after ""Spider-man: Across the Spiderverse"" and it basically does a lot of what that film did but it did not do it better.
There are many scenes where the faces of the characters (mostly the flash) are obviously CGI. There are also scenes where The Flash stops time and it just looks very animated. Namely the scene that involves multiple babies. This didn't take away from my experience but it was noticeable on numerous occasions. There was also a Spanish song used during an emotional scene that didn't fit. It was very random and confusing.
Ezra Miller was enjoyable playing different versions of himself and showing his range as actor. He delivered some serious emotional moments as well as some silly comedic moments.
Sasha Calle as supergirl felt like a weak attempt at including ""Superman"" into the story and this film would have worked better without it. I didn't hate her character, she was just okay.
General Zod was another character that didn't work in this film. I understand why he was included and how he was used to tie together this multiverse idea but he wasn't exciting.
The character I had the most fun watching on screen was Batman. Every version of him was just amazing and exciting to see. Every scene that involved Batman felt crisp and well done while The Flash had many clunky scenes. On a side note, Michael Keaton's involvement in this film should have been kept a secret. The trailers continue to show too much ruining movie experiences.
There were some cool cameos in this film but as I stated before it has been done before. I expected more from this film considering the amount of times it was delayed. There were some cool scenes and action sequences but this movie needed a better story. The characters just weren't strong enough for the audience to care about them. Sometimes less is more but sometimes a character has such a small role that it's much better not to include them (Iris West).
In the end I just felt like I've seen this movie already with different characters. I still look forward to the next film I just hope it goes in a different direction and leaves the timelines alone.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur161226852/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9123662/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-16
tt0439572;The Flash;ztigr;Obviously the bad CGI was meant to be that way. I don't understand those complaints. Probably one of the best DC movies with original story telling since the Dark Knight Series. Michael Keaton was great, and overall a homage to the good parts of the Snyderverse. So many tributes to so many people's visions of what the DC universe should be. The Salkinds and Jon Peters should feel honored. How sad that Ezra Miller has such talent and he cant be sane in his real life. Overall it was a nice wrap up to the DC universe, though I realize a couple more are on the way. I am interested to see what James Gunn will do, but the super hero genre may be going the way of the Western overall.

tt0439572;The Flash;olcare;"There are so many things I could say about the film that I don't know where to begin. Most of what I'm going to say will contain heavy spoilers and will often be criticism because the film disappointed me.
First, let me talk about the few good parts of the film that I actually liked. Michael Keaton was by far the best in the film. I believe his excellent performance elevated the otherwise bad film. I actually liked Ben Affleck's Batman action scene, albeit very briefly. It gave me some hope at the beginning of the film, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to that. I quite liked Sasha Calle's Supergirl. She was the best in terms of action, and I hope she doesn't get recast unnecessarily because I really liked her. Overall, I think the issues with the DCEU lie more in the scripts rather than the cast. Ezra Miller was just okay, nothing special, in terms of his acting.
From here on, what I'm going to say will be purely critical. First and foremost, the film had some of the worst CGI I've ever seen. Despite all the delays, corrections, and previews, the CGI was simply unacceptable. I didn't like the color palette and the choice of locations for the action scenes either. Especially in the Zod fight, the selection of the location (green screen) was incredibly poor. I didn't like the editing of the time travel scenes. The way they handled the parallel universes, as well as visualizing the flow of time, was terrible. There were too many jokes, making it difficult to establish an emotional connection. However, none of these were my biggest issue. Despite overlooking the CGI, editing, and directing errors, I couldn't get past the absurdity and the badness of the final scene. Let me explain: there are three versions of Flash in the end, and the film has reached its climax, with Zod being in an unbeatable situation and already giving some cameos, yet when you expect an impressive last fight with meaningful and scientifically plausible dialogue, they present a childish dialogue like ""It's your fault, Nexus"" with empty dialogue. The idea of resetting the universe in such a simplistic and bland way is just terrible. I felt embarrassed, truly embarrassed, while watching that final scene. With already terrible CGI and cameo designs, the overly simple and uninspiring ending made me incredibly sad. Additionally, after somehow dealing with the Nexus, seeing George Clooney in an unrelated manner felt out of place. If they were going for a semi-reset, should it have been handled like this? I don't know.
In short, the presence of a few good actors and actresses couldn't save the film from being a disaster due to extremely poor writing, directing, and editing. Whether it's Flash creating the Nexus, the fight scene colors, CGI, or the resolution of the events, including the attempted universe reset, everything was poorly executed, and I didn't see any directorial vision. It was a straightforward film.
I believe people get carried away by small surprises and nostalgic intoxication. Yes, nostalgia feels sweet, and the cameos may make you go ""Wow,"" but the overall coherence of the film has changed so much that it cannot maintain consistency in either time travel or other aspects. I wish they had turned the film into a darker tone from the beginning rather than turning it into a jigsaw puzzle. Maybe then, the trio of Sasha Calle, Michael Keaton, and Michael Shannon would have shined even more. While the idea may be Flashpoint, this isn't a Flashpoint film; they just whispered ""Flashpoint"" in the film's ear. The DCEU has significantly lowered my expectations and disappointed me. Hopefully, James Gunn can bring a solution to this chaos and the incomplete reset. I can't deny that I miss Zack Snyder's colors and style.
Update: I want to make an addition, I saw an explanation after the movie. So, apparently, they intentionally made the CGI bad in the scenes with time travel because that's how it looks from Flash's perspective or something like that. I've heard very few things as absurd as deliberately making CGI bad. The film's budget seems to be 200 million dollars, which is quite a significant amount. It's strange to me that people believe everything the studio and director say. I mean, the explanation for the scene where Flash extends his head through the portal shouldn't be that they intentionally made the CGI bad.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur98064456/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9126875/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-17
tt0439572;The Flash;gtamaniak-16300;"WARNING MEGA SPOILERS!!!!
I saw The Flash today in the movie theater and I was kind of disappointed with its mediocrity. First of all, I have to say that the CGI sometimes, it looks bad. In the scene where the babies fall from the skyscrapper and Barry is trying to save them, man.. it has some of the worst CGI technology generated by the worst A. I ever. Everything looks so fake in that scene. The special fanservice scene where the universes collide with one another also has some poor effects but I can forgive them because of the awesome cameos (most of them are deepfakes, AI generated faces according to The Flash wikipedia page). I think Zack Snyder's Justice League had better visual and special effects. There where a few plot points that were kind of stupid too. Such as Barry's ""low calory"" meter. How come this never came up in the two Justice League movies but now it's a problem? Is it because of his suit? But isn't it the same suit he wore in the JL movies? Now I want to say that it is never made clear in the movie if Barry travelled in the past or another universe in order to prevent his mother's murder scene (we also don't even get a look at how his mother got murdered, not even one powerful scene involving Barry confronting the murderer unlike in other media.) because when the murder is prevented the batman is now Michael Keaton and not Ben Affleck, but I'm going to follow the DCEU wiki and say that in the world of the Keaton Batman, everything after took place in the same universe where The Batman (1989) and The Batman Returns (1992) took place (I think this movie ignores the Schumacher films), just in a much later date. Other problems include 2013 Barry acting like an annoying obnoxious idiot for the most part and the fact that there is no serious reset in the timeline. Instead we get an ending meant to troll the true DC fans with George Clooney being the new Batman and an after credits scene so insignificant, that it makes the Superman cameo from Black Adam seem very important. I don't think they did a good job with the story. The film had such a serious premise yet the tone was very light and joyful. I wish this was directed by Zack Snyder. They could have done so much more those damn writers. Also there was no explanation as to how Earth-1 Barry lost his powers and it was boring watching a whimp Barry who from Earth-89 who doesn't even know to do his loundry learning to use his new powers.
What I liked? All the action scenes were damn amazing and exciting. I'd say the scenes with both Batmen in particular were the absolute highlight besides the awesome fan-service multiverse scene. Supergirl was also cool in my opinion. Another cool scene is 2013-Flash doing the Raiden Fatality from MK Deception on a Kryptonian. Dark Flash also looked very cool and was a well-thought out character to put in the story.
It was also terrifying how they couldn't defeat Zod and each attempt always brought a result in which Zod won. It seems only Superman could defeat him. I wonder if Earth-89 Zod will travel the multiverse and appear in future DCU movies?
All in all, in terms of story this movie was weak and I don't think I'll buy it on DVD when it comes out.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur107688691/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9122877/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-15
tt0439572;The Flash;jhocken-28771;"The Flashpoint Paradox is one of my favorite comic books, and is the only comic to make me cry. The relationship between Barry and his powers, the maturity of his final decision to undo the time manipulation he undertakes, and the alternate versions of classic characters all make that story an epic tale and one that would translate so well to the big screen.
The Flash has none of that in any good capacity. The writing in this film is infantile, trying to be funny constantly and delivering on none of it. The incessant CGI looks horrible. The movie seems to be a pasting together of meme content from around the internet in a hope to arouse interest.
Let's start with the writing. To give a good look at how they wrote this film, let's concern ourselves with the pivotal line: ""Not every problem has a solution. Sometimes you just need to let go."" This is spoken by Barry's mother to him as he tries to complete MATH HOMEWORK. How dumb can it get? That's horrible advice for a child doing math homework, it's unnatural to talk like that, and it's so obvious what the writers are actually getting at with the line, including their intention of bringing the line back later. To add to it, Barry has the audacity to accuse another character's entry line as being rehearsed. The other problem with the writing is that it is obsessed with shoehorning jokes and leaving spaces for audience laughter. My theater was silent throughout. The gags are borderline slapstick, and Barry Allen, a supposedly smart, witty scientist superhero, seems to be living with Roger Rabbit and taking speech cues from him.
Next, the CGI. Avatar: The Way of Water just wowed us with how fantastic a movie can look. The Flash seems to believe that immersive visuals are an option. Every other shot had at least one actor fully replaced with CGI, and seeing as there are two characters played by the same actor in most of this movie, that's a SERIOUS PROBLEM. The first scene with the two of them looked really good; I don't know why the quality took a nosedive from then on. Every bit of CG face looked like it was constructed from clay, and I couldn't help but think about how Red Dead Redemption 2 looked more lifelike than this motion picture.
The writers and producers of this film seemed to think that what the world needed, as a response to such multiversal entries into popular culture as the Spiderverse movies and Godzilla, was Nicholas Cage as Superman. Of course, Nicholas Cage doesn't really make an appearance in the movie, but a CGI version of his likeness based on the decades-old rumors of him donning the red cape disgraces the screen in a cringe-inducing cap to the climax of the film. Memes everywhere, as if that's how you should write a movie.
I was really hoping for a bit of greatness here. I have been disappointed for years with Snyder's terrible butchering of solid characters, and I was even willing to look past the few minutes we have with the fake Batman we've had from the DCEU. Unfortunately, Affleck was one of the better parts of The Flash. He managed to not go murdering everybody like he's done in the past (not Batman), and his acting and action were pretty solid. Another hero that kept me in my seat was Cara-El, written and acted rather competently, especially compared to our protagonists.
5 out of 10. Go see it if you LOVE Michael Keaton in the suit, but don't expect to see him doing any karate chopping. They leave all that difficult stuff to the computers.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104893512/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9123145/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-15
tt0439572;The Flash;tresm87;"I gotta be honest and say that I thought this movie was dead in the water during the worst antics of Ezra Miller last year. I'm convinced WB conjured up a crucial plan to recover this film and the overall stigma behind it with one main aspect. MORE Batman. Not just Batman but Michael Keaton's adorned classic version. While he was already going to be a part of the film before in some amount, I truly believe that the re-shoots and rewrites amped his involvement in the overall stakes and story much more. Well it clearly worked and the hype surrounding the film has been completely due to Keaton's Bat. That's not to say the story and other aspects even including Miller aren't solid as well.
I was lucky to see the advance screening a few weeks back and it was an experience to remember. This is easily the highlight entry in the DCEU. It soars in visuals, emotional depth, and nostalgia tenfold. This may be a Flash film but Michael Keaton steals the show returning to his classic iteration of the Bat. It's like he never took a 30 year hiatus. The guy is just so iconic it's unbelievable . The way he is incorporated is perfect for the plotting and the stakes. Miller himself is also very captivating in the film as well as Affleck. Michael Shannon once again gives a great dark horse role as well. The casting of supergirl though I cannot say was a great decision. She is without a doubt the weakest link imo.
The visual spectacle is without a doubt the reason to watch this and no matter how heavily cgi laden it can be, it manages to usually look crisp and colorful. To see Keaton in his signature batwing moving around in an updated time is something to behold. It's crazy to see something that couldn't have been dreamed of in 89/92.
Overall it's awesome to finally get this film and to see so many exciting aspects come together to create the long awaited standalone flash film.

The fanboys seem to raise this movie to the sky. Sure this is miles better than BvS, JL, and WonderWoman 1984, but is that the bar DC has set now? Because a movie is slightly better than some of the worst movies of all time we need to give it a 9 or 10 in scores? Really?

tt8270664;Ambush;Brendan3;"I hope Aaron Eckhart was paid well for the half day of work he did on one set. At least, fortunately for him, this film will be quickly forgotten. And it's sad to see Jonathan Rhys Meyers' career reduced to signing on to dreck like this.
The plot is simple enough.
Vietnam. 1966. A remote American firebase is attacked and the Viet-Cong, though driven back, somehow manage to get their hands on a binder that would compromise South Vietnamese agents. A small force is dispatched from the firebase to track and find the VC in order to retrieve or destroy the binder.
The basic outline for this plot could have made for a decent action movie in the hands of competent film makers. Unfortunately, none were available.
It is clear that the film makers did no research. I began to wonder if they could even spot Vietnam on a map.
Sometimes a film with a low budget will get the look wrong because they can't afford to build realistic looking sets or props... in this case, it seemed they simply didn't care about getting anything right
Production and costumes: None of the characters were wearing the right uniforms or patches. You can literally order bulk surplus jungle fatigues online... this was not a budget issue... they simply got all the uniforms wrong. Every single one.
This was also glaringly obvious with the weapons. The overwhelming majority of the soldiers in this film are seen using M16A2 or A3 rifles... rifles which were not available until 20 years later. One soldier who has a beard for some reason was actually carrying an M16A4 with a rail system, a gun that wan not available until more than 30 years later.
Clearly the production had the budget for an armorer who could provide expensive rifles... just the wrong ones... all of them.
While most laymen may not notice the difference, anyone who ever served in the military in the last fifty years will and this is just indicative of the indifference or laziness of the film makers.
The location set for the firebase was laughably bad, on a par with a high school play's stage scenery. This was not a budget issue.. this was not caring or bothering. Sandbags don't cost a lot. A single later of sandbags on only one side of a machine gun position is decorative but useless. It wouldn't have taken more that a minute to google images to see how sandbags are used and maybe an extra hour to fill a whole bunch of bags.
The script: Every cliche imaginable... and the writer clearly has no understanding of how the military works of how human beings talk to each other... and of course there are many pieces of dialog that are out of place... like one soldier complaining about eating MRE's even though it would be twenty more years before the Army switched over to eating MRES from canned C-rations. Corporals run bases and give orders to sergeants. Captains scream at everything all the time because the writer associates screaming with Army movies. And colonels lead patrols. The script is rife with every cliche imaginable ""they died for nothing!"" and when someone talks about how they're about to finish their tour and go home, you know he's about to die
The action is why I gave this film two stars instead of one... because I actually laughed at how bad it was. There were lots of bad CGI muzzle flash and explosion effects. The Viet Cong seem to love just standing in the open and firing instead of maybe shooting from behind a tree... and there were multiple scenes were actors were shooting each other in the back (fortunately with blanks) because the director didn't bother to tell them to not point their rifles at each other when running around firing. It's actually quite comical and I challenge viewers to count how many times they see actors shooting at each other. There was a stuntman falling from a tower too early before an explosion went off at the base of it that the director left in. As CGI mortar strike explosions in several scenes and in one scene, a stuntman throws himself flailing as if blasted by an explosion ...but they forgot to add that CGI explosion so the scene is just him flailing as he leaps sideways reacting to... nothing.
I guess the best way to sum up this movie is to look at the title... ""Ambush"" There is no Ambush.
After the firebase is attacked, a captain is on the radio with a general talking about the attack and they both keep referring to it as an ambush. The attack on the base is referred to as an ambush several more times.
But an assault or raid on a base is not an ambush.
That the film makers titled their film ""Ambush"" and don't even know what that means really says it all.";2;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0471590/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8902670/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-03-03

tt8270664;Ambush;Ribradach;"The show starts with a place and date, 1966. In the background, an F-111. That didn't even enter service until a year later and didn't come to Vietnam until 1968.
There then follows a sequence of macho macho man orders and posturing. So lame, it's beyond parody.
The Special Forces captain flies to a base to receive a special secret package. Why he can fly in and not fly back out again using the same helicopter (or even any helicopter) having collected the famous package is never explained.
Upon arrival there is more screaming authoritarianism - clearly the script writers haven't ever been on a military base. Laughably, the OC for this base is a corporal. Whose mean keep calling him ""Sir"". His demeanour is that of an earnest but ridiculous one pip wonder, but even so, the ""Special Forces"" captain does nothing but belittle him and scream at him. Whilst also addressing him as if he is in command of a 50 man detachment...
Next, a guy manning a machine gun and whizzing the iron sights around spots two US Special Forces snipers in full ghillie suits about 200M out from his position and challenges them.
They stand up and assert that they have ""the package"", a book marker ""Secret"" inside a plastic map case. When asked if the enemy (who knew that the Vietnamese marked secret documents in English?) knew that they had this document, the snipers earnestly responded that there were 8 of them, implying that 6 comrades had died (or been captured). Having not answered a straight question with a straight answer, the hitherto highly strung SF captain says he needs to arrange some ""R&R"" for the newly arrived hero's.
Whereupon someone (another trembling nerd engineer) accidentally discharges his weapon, causing the SF captain to drop the ""Secret"" documents in the mud so he can regain his title of the most screamy man in Vietnam. Another trembling nerd (for this is what combat engineers are according to this film, or perhaps are reduced to by the overwhelming machismo of the SF presence) picks it up and has a gun out in his face by one of the ""sniper"" team.
As the captain resumes screaming at the other corporal (one of whom discharged the gun and is made out to be far more junior in rank than the other who is again made out to be the detachment OC), I decide that the 20 minutes lost to date is more than enough.

tt8270664;Ambush;Top_Dawg_Critic;Had the convoluted, disjointed, unremarkable and tedious screenplay from the three writers been cut down to about 80 mins, this may have been more enjoyable. Certainly more enjoyable than having to listen to cliched tropes and long dragged out and repetitive scenes of dead end turns in an underground maze.

tt8270664;Ambush;Shanghai_Expat;"The premise of the movie is pretty good and they have some really talented actors, but you can feel something is off right from the beginning, especially if you have been in the military or even are just a connoisseur of military movies / documentaries.
A forward base is something we've all seen, but as soon as you lay eyes on this base, even a five year-old would wonder why on earth anyone would build a base like that. Why do they have like 30 guys on the base, no vehicles, but like 100 55 gallon drums?
The whole premise of the movie is that they come in possession of a secret binder with a complete list of secret agent locations and need to protect it. Someone accidentally discharges a weapon and the special forces captain throws the binder on the ground to go yell at the guy which allows a ditch-digger to get to thumb through it. What?! C'mon!
The dialogue just seems off too. When one 20-year old ditch digger, asks the other 20 year-old ditch digger what was in the binder - he asks 'Did it look like a ledger?"" Who the heck would say that?
When the base gets attacked, they hide the binder in an ammo can in the HQ. What!? It's literally one inch thick, anyone who'd job it was to protect it would put it down this pants, or bury it under one of the hundreds of 55-gallon drums, it would never be found even if they totally lost the base.
In another ridiculous situation, as the base is being attacked, the captain orders every single soldier to leave the base to peruse the retreating attackers. It must not have seemed ridiculous enough, because then both the retreating and the pursuing solders then both stand in the open unloading machine gun fire at each other - AK-47 versus M16 at about 20 or 30 yards.
Mark Burman is an accomplished writer / director / producer, but quite honestly he really should have hired a military consultant on this one.

tt8270664;Ambush;paul_haakonsen;"When I sat down to watch ""Ambush"", I figured that chances were that it would prove a good movie since it had the likes of Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Aaron Eckhart on the cast list.
However, prior to sitting down and watching this movie from director Mark Burman, I hadn't even heard about it. So I wasn't sure what I was in for here, aside from it being a Vietnam War movie of sorts.
Writers Mark Burman, Johnny Lozano, Michael McClung and Dillon Slack put together a fair enough script for the storyline here. And while ""Ambush"" certainly was interesting enough, the movie was ultimately sort of nondistinctive, and it sort of feels like a movie that snuck in under the radar and will just as quietly fade into oblivion. The movie didn't leave a particularly lasting impression with me. While ""Ambush"" was watchable, it should be noted that there are far, far better Vietnam War-based movies out there.
The acting in the movie was good, but I feel a little bit cheated out of something, as neither Jonathan Rhys Meyers or Aaron Eckhart weren't playing all that big roles in the movie. Meyers did, however, have a bit more on-screen time than Eckhart, but they weren't leading performers. I guess they were top billed solely to lure in the audience.
""Ambush"" was filmed in a good manner, because it felt like the audience were right there alongside the US soldiers as they ventured into unknown territory as they realized that the Viet Cong troops were using subterranean tunnels in their warfare. There was a particular sense of intense tension and claustrophobia throughout the course of the 104 minutes that the movie ran for, and that definitely helped carry the movie.
For a war movie then director Mark Burman delivered a watchable movie, albeit not a particularly outstanding movie. This is the type of movie that you watch once, then shelf it and forget about it.

An inexperienced group of young American soldiers need to survey the entire tunnel system in order to find an important secret list that has gotten into the hands of the Vietcong. Will they find it or die trying?
The good; there is a contineous suspense, with lots of creeping around underground in tunnels, having to fear for your life of meeting the Vietcong soldiers at every corner of a new tunnel entrance. On top of that there is the fear of getting lost in this underground maze of tunnels.
The big names (Aaron Eckhart and Jonathan Rhys Meyers) only play small supporting roles, so if you expect to see them much, that will be disappointment. The entire movie is carried by young unknown actors, who act quite well fortunately.

tt8270664;Ambush;Doctor-of-Nothing;"As in war, not every aspect of the film Ambush probably goes as it was strategically intended in pre-production, but its heart, politics, and key performances fight hard to make a difference and by the end of its hour and 40 minute running time can claim victory.
The year is 1966. The setting is a small firebase in Quan Tri erected and secured by a corp of young inexperienced engineers with next to no bona fides in combat. The platoon is commanded by Cpl. Ackerman (Connor Paolo) - who is educated and savvy but trepidatious because he knows what he does not know... and his men know it too. The titular ambush takes place above ground - the enemy appearing out of nowhere in the midst of the camp's secured perimeter - during which they manage to steal an important dossier before being repelled. The remainder of the film mostly takes place underground as Ackerman and his team are tasked with the mission of mapping the Vietcong's 'subway system', the labyrinth of tunnels they have constructed in the area that allow them free and unseen movement in their battles against the Americans.
Once in the tunnels, the film takes on more of an effective horror film vibe with booby traps, silence, claustrophobia, sudden attacks and a John Carpenteresque 80's soundtrack. But the film never lets the viewer forget that the real horror is the lethal mix of the politics of war and the caste system of the armed forces. To this end, the film's finale is particularly forceful.
Aaron Eckhart as General Drummond, remotely directing the operation, does his steely best, but his performance, literally over the phone, is detached in a multitude of ways. Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Special Forces operative Miller, who is knowledgeable about the tunnels but stays above ground, provides an understanding and a Zen-like calmness to the endeavor, a welcome counterbalance to the barking of the other higher-ups. But the real pulse of the story and heart of the film is Connor Paolo's portrayal of Ackerman who's journey from trying hard to conceal his fears about protecting his men above ground to revealing his deep care, compassion and responsibility for them underground is truly moving.
For a low budget war film with what appeared to be an extremely short shooting schedule, Ambush tells a story about the politics of war well worth seeing. The fact that it eschews back stories of both the larger and the smaller life forms benefits it theme: that at the end of the chess game, all the pieces - kings, queens, bishops, knights and pawns - go back in the same box.";9;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur9406274/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8891938/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-02-25

Attention to detail is incredible, very well written and directed.
This film takes place predominantly underground in a network of small, narrow tunnels that were dug by the Vietcong during the Vietnam War in the 1960s. A group of inexperienced young American soldiers must navigate the entire tunnel system to locate a crucial secret list that has fallen into the hands of the Vietcong. Will they succeed in finding it, or will their efforts cost them their lives?
The film excels in maintaining a continuous sense of suspense, as the characters cautiously navigate the underground tunnels, constantly aware of the ever-present danger of encountering Vietcong soldiers around each corner. Moreover, there is the constant fear of becoming lost in the labyrinthine underground maze.
While notable actors like Aaron Eckhart and Jonathan Rhys Meyers only play minor supporting roles, the movie predominantly relies on talented young unknown actors who deliver commendable performances.

It has one of the coolest, longest and most impressive simulated one-takes I've ever seen. I was mesmerized.
The only criticism I have is that it's anticlimactic. The best action scene happens early, second best happens in the middle, and the last action scene is the smallest (but still good). Other than that, I loved this movie.
As someone who constantly trashes the inferior quality of Netflix original movies, I have to give them credit here. And as a huge fan of fight scenes and action movies, I'm ecstatic at the new levels I've seen from franchises like this and John Wick.

I could hardly believe what I was watching; helicopters landing on moving trains and cameras going in and out of windows have never been easier to follow.

Starter tip: skip the first 20 minutes of talking, action starts from 20 minutes onward.
The good: the only redeeming feature of this movie is the (often, not always) terrific action photography. There are a few (about 3) long action sequences that could come straight out of a Mission Impossible movie. The same wow factor. Really impressive. There are lots of over the top special effects stunts that are out of whack. Nice!
Too bad though that they didnt restrain themselves from using too much CGI, it would have even further enhanced some of these terrific action scenes. Mind you there is a lot (A LOT) of ""filler"" action as well, with shootouts that are NOT impressive in any way. Bummer.
The bad: when there is no action though, this movie really fails. Big time. I mean, the characters are cardboard. The dialogues are cringeworthy. The whole story about Chris Hemsworth saving a mother and her 2 children is terrible, up to a level that I simply had to skip these ridiculous talking scenes, that only held up the action.
Definitely not great as a whole, but worth one watch for (some of) the action spectacle scenes.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur84924605/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9127629/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-17

The way this one follows on the first film in the franchise isn't really clear to me because I didn't see the first one. At this point, fans will tell me to shut up, so I probably should. The action in Extraction 2 is for the most part unbelievable, but it's well done.
The Georgian brothers are not fully fleshed out, so their backstory takes a little flashing back to establish what we are to expect from them.

tt12263384;Extraction 2;koltonbrett;"Extraction 2 is expectedly not as good as its predecessor, but it's still a solid action film. I appreciate that it knows what it is and only pauses the action long enough for us to catch our breath. It has some of the longest continual action sequences I've seen, and thankfully, it's all pretty fun to watch.
However, the story didn't have the emotional depth of the first Extraction. The person being extracted in that first film was a fantastic addition to the story. The extracted persons in this story are flat characters that only exist as an objective to be carried out. This makes the story much weaker than the first, as does the use of too many storytelling cliches that we're all too familiar with. The action saves the movie, but even then, watching the two Extraction movies back to back feels like an overindulgence in gun fights. It's not uncommon for me to watch two connected movies that are so samey, I'm left with no desire to see a third one. While these two Extraction movies are guilty of being too samey, they're good enough that I would happily watch a third one. Despite these weaknesses keeping me from calling it a great movie, I have no trouble saying it's a good one.
There's a lot to like here. The acting is great. Chris Hemsworth is at home with this type of role. The picture quality and cinematography is simply excellent. The camera movement and angles alone are a work of art. The movie isn't based on a video game, yet it's a better video game movie than actual video game movies. The way we walk through extended action sequences battling seemingly endless waves of attacking enemy soldiers, feels just like the campaign of many of the games I've played. I found it quite interesting. It sounds like there is indeed going to be a third movie, and I hope they figure out how to make the action not so similar to the first two movies, because I'll definitely be watching it.";7;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur144012653/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9135774/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-20
tt12263384;Extraction 2;godsnames;A deeper story, more emotions, and even more spectacular action make this sequel way better than the original, contrary to Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian who gave 1 star out of 5 to this spectacular and rather entertaining project. He accused Chris Hemsworth of wanting more money for his troubles from Netflix, which may be true, but missed the point entirely by devaluing a modern action movie as money hungry crap. By all means, it is not. The story is much better because it humanizes its characters in a good sense, showing just enough - and not more - emotions to give it more layers than bang-bang. Golshifteh Farahani and Adam Bessa are both bullseye casting as so is Tornike Gogrichiani as the villain. The acting, camerawork, editing and most notably the score all shows unquestionable high production values of a Hollywood blockbuster. It is a modern action flick that leaves behind the past couple of decades' attempts, elevating it to the heights of the best James Bond and Mission Impossible efforts.;8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur64478689/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9125902/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-17

So I'm a little confused.... ...because I remember the first movie seeking more realistic. Or at least as far as Hollywood goes.
The intro is slow, but once he takes a month of rehab to fully cure from a destroyed body and clinically dying...he is back in mission.
And then it's an action scene that really feels like it's never going to end. And I kind of wished it to stop. It was like the john wick 4 stair scene...but lasted 30 min straight. The only thing I could think is, if these forces could rally a literal army in seconds to this extraction...where they heck were they all seconds prior to prevent it.
I'm 46 min in and literally nothing if substance has occurred yet. If it wasn't for Chris hemsworth being in it, I would have turned it off 25 min ago. I disappointed because the last one was so good. There was a more soy craft to it.

tt12263384;Extraction 2;rossmcdee1;"This is a very badly written film with some incredible stunt-work and (sort of) impressive action sequences.
It's based on a comic book. The writers, the Russo Brothers have also written & directed a few MARVEL Universe films and this is another superhero bash-fest with a bulletproof, invincible hero, in fact almost everyone in the film is bulletproof- with actors getting shot at point blank range without flinching.
Of course this is impossible. It would be akin to getting sledgehammered in the chest , and many bullet proof vests would only stop a bullet near the centre. Uncannily no one gets shot in the legs, or arms, though they get stabbed there.
No one tires while fighting, even though they wear heavy body armour and a ton of weaponry. The fights are well choreographed with an impressive long take scene near the start, yet it is also so ludicrous that it remains as contrived as the rest of the film. No one seems to reload their guns, no one gets bruised properly, Chris H. Even gets shot in the hand and can still hold onto a metal beam and dangling accomplice without even having to grit his teeth !
Lots of stuff gets blown up, no one gets singed, eyeballs don't melt and the hole thing plays out like a VIDEO GAME.
The CGI is decent mostly, with some crude green screen on some helicopter moments. However, none of the CGI or pyrotechnics actually seem to interact with the actors apart from in one fight scene with an arm on fire... Twice helicopters blow up right next to Chris H. And he barely notices... Everyone in this film would be permanently or temporarily deaf after having so many explosions and gunshots right next to their heads.
Cliched villains; daft storyline; ridiculous decisions and events; unlikeable characters and a sound scape that alternates between clanging gunshots, explosions; screaming & primal grunting to whispered melodrama and cliched misery mongering.
Many moments were comically bad due to their mawkish sentimental manipulations. This isn't helped by the most predictable score/soundtrack imaginable- a mish mash of every other action film soundtrack you can remember from the mid 1980s on.
The colour palette used is vile. The new fashion for lifeless colour, drab green-brown tones and sterile grey-blues dominate the bleak proceedings. Much of it is filmed in dark , dank claustrophobic places.
As an action film fan I can forgive many ludicrous and daft moments in this genre , but not a whole film filled with them without respite.
So, some great stunt work and a decent attempt at fight choreography from a US film , that is almost as good as some of the Asian film industry moments of the 1980's & 90's + Korean films the last decade ( in fact directly inspired by Police Story 3 & the Raid in part) are the only redeemable aspects to this masochistic escapist fantasy with nothing to really say and with no bearing on anyone's real lives, except maybe as some computer video game nostalgia ?";3;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20217147/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9125801/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-16

tt12263384;Extraction 2;SAMTHEBESTEST;"Extraction 2 (2023) : Movie Review -
Sam Hargreave is back with Chris Hemsworth in Extraction 2. Following the similar pattern of Extraction (2020), Extraction 2 continues to roar in the action zone, but just like its predecessor, it also suffers from weak writing and an emotionally poor plot. Extraction became quite popular in India in 2020 since many people saw it during the lockdown and had no other option. That wasn't the only reason, though. Netflix, OTT platforms, and big action films coming to the OTT were new and exciting things back then. Now, we have become habitual to all that stuff, so a film has to be really good to work big time. Extraction 2 is a faithful sequel, if not great. It serves what fans seek, and therefore it can't be blamed for being loyal to its fanbase and overlooking critics.
Taking off from Extraction, the film begins with the scene of Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) being wounded and falling into the river. Since he is our hero, he cannot die, so he survives the bullet in his neck. I don't know how it's possible in this universe, but he did. In the recovery process, a nameless fella (Idris Elba) visits him and offers him a new assignment. Tyler, along with Nik Kahn (Golshifteh Farahani) and Yaz Kahn (Adam Bessa), fly to Austria to rescue a Georgian gangster's family from prison. There he picks up a little girl, a woman, and her son, who are being chased by a mercenary named Zurab (Tornike Gogrichiani). Tyler has to save the family from Zurab and his men and find a way out of the country.
One good thing about the Extraction series is that it stays true to its genre. If it calls itself an action drama, then it stays an action flick throughout the film. Other times, we hardly see an action film being action for two hours as several elements like romance, drama, family, betrayal, and others do happen in between. Extraction 2 is about the action getting bigger and more thrilling. Extraction 1 had a long one-take action piece between Chris and Randeep Hooda, while Extraction 2 has an even longer sequence of Tyler taking on many mercenaries in different places. That sequence lasts for about 20 minutes or so, and it is made to look like a one-take scene, even though we have a few deceptive explosions to fool our eyes. It might be a one-take scene too; I don't know. One cannot take his eyes off that scene; it's so good. It's breathtaking!
Chris Hemsworth is gritty as Tyler Rake, just as was expected. He is a badass hero with an emotional backdrop that is still not well explored. In Extraction 2, we have a slightly better introduction of those characters, but it's nothing that accessible. He is amazing in action scenes and delivers a fine punch of machoism. The gorgeous looks of Golshifteh Farahani continue to mesmerise you, and she also kicks some a***. The coordination between Chris and Golshifteh is flawless, and I'd love to see them get a little romantic in the future. Am I asking for too much or what? Adam Bessa passes the time well, Olga Kurylenko and Tinatin Dalakishvili are okay, and Idris Elbai is a surprise package in a cameo that might get bigger soon. Tornike Gogrichiani presents a deadly villain who is well supported by Levan Saginashvili.
Extraction 2 lacks depth in scripting and storytelling. The screenplay is pacy but has no elements related to writing. Of course, you cannot write action; you have to design it as a spectacle, and that's not a writer's job. Greg Baldi's cinematography in that one-take action sequence will blow your mind. The camera follows every moment of the characters; it moves ahead with them, even capturing wide frames. It rides in a car, goes on top, sneaks out of explosions, and then goes on a trip on a train. How difficult are all things to imagine, but they made them possible, and how fantastically. The dialogues have some crispness too. I mean, ""Do you trust me?"" has been a cliche, but what new can we get in an answer? ""Should I not?"" is what we get here. Sam Hargrave creates a sequel that lives up to the fan mania and nothing else. Extraction 2 raises the bar of action for the franchise, but I wish they had raised the standard of the script too. Enjoy the action and forgive the writing.

Just sit back, relax and enjoy the insane action in this film, hopefully Chris decides to make at least one more film to complete a trilogy. His acting has gotten so much better as he's gotten older, this kind of movie suits him so much. In the vein of films such as John Wick, Nobody and several of Jason Statham's films, Chris' character Tyler Rake is the latest badass who destroys hordes of villains in his quest to rescue a family stuck in the middle of some nefarious schemes. Action takes place in several locations with another one take action scene spanning around 20 minutes which is just as exciting, if not more than the first film.

tt12263384;Extraction 2;sd-lister;"I thought Russo was a decent writer, but Extraction 2 is a horrible mess. To begin, they can't even maintain continuity with the first movie, which was very well done, lots of plausible action, in a unique setting.
Here, we get ridiculous Rocky style training, silly, overdone stunts (and not in a cool, John Wick sort of way), massive, unbelievable plot holes, and a location choice that just screams typical low budget action movie filmed in Europe (Austria/Czech Republic). Even the ""good"" action sequences were marred by a complete lack of realism with characters literally dodging a hailstorm of bullets from machine guns and helicopter door-gunners alike (who were about as accurate as the average Storm Trooper). The sheer amount of disbelief that viewers have to suspend to make this movie even marginally enjoyable is simply too much-I'm so disappointed with this effort and the missed opportunity, that not only do I not want to watch a third movie, I'm actively rooting against it. They should have ended the first movie as intended, and kept it as a standalone masterpiece (compared to this drivel), if they weren't going to devote the necessary care to the sequels.
I appreciate the use of the many Georgian actors, all of whom do an admirable job, it's just too bad the filming didn't happen there. Regardless, Hemsworth turns in a pretty decent performance, but I think Golshifteh Farahani and Adam Bessa steal the show, such as it is. Their performances were believable and it was evident they committed to their weapon manipulation training.
All in all, it's a very disappointing return for director Sam Hargrave. I think in his effort to deliver a Keanu Reeves like action fest, Hargrave loses track of what makes John Wick's violence so grounded. Instead, we get a movie that's just one choreographed action sequence after another without any heart or substance behind it (amazingly, these actually get tedious and boring after a while). To be fair, it's not like Russo offered anything close to a compelling narrative this time around either. Between the two, they destroy all the potential this film had. Instead, we get a mediocre vehicle that feels like it's all about milking the Netflix cash cow. And that's a damn shame.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24239056/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9126578/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-17
tt12263384;Extraction 2;Silverdashmax;"The movie is ok, it has decent dialogue and very well thought out action. However in spite of great action scenes and excessive violence the plot is poorly thought out relies on many unrealistic factors.
So firstly the good: the action is mostly well thought out with wounds affecting the fighting styles as the movie progresses, characters get tired and worn out showed by a slowing of pacing. Unlike recent action movies characters in a fight don't necessarily come at the main character one at a time. Whilst there are occasions where ""bad guys"" come at the ""good guys"" one at a time because they're preoccupied. Alternatively when the opposition are available to fight they do. In some scenes you can see multiple people fighting in a 2v1, group pile-on, 3v2's etcetera.
Next character arcs for some characters make sense. Tyler, the protagonist's, arc throughout the movie is one of self hate due to the inability to be there for his own child. But by the end he forgives himself. The main antagonist is self-destructive for the sake of revenge on the protagonist, forsaking everything in order to destroy the protagonist and his accomplices.
However despite the good, many aspects of this movie hang on the head of one character who extends this movie from being 55 minutes long into a 1 hour 50 movie. This character of course is the inexplicably stupid teenage boy named Sandro. Now don't get me wrong, Andro Japaridze does a great job of acting and none of the fault falls on his head. In fact for the script and dialogue given to his character, Andro Japaridze out performed the role. However due to the producers need to extend the movie and lazy writing, his character, Sandro, is turned into a plot device.
Firstly do the writers actually expect a elite spec-ops mercenary crew member to be reckless enough to leave a tactical cell phone on a table in eyesight of an angsty teen, but they also believe that the same teen who so far has demonstrated no functional capability to be able to sneak off with the phone and then send a message to the same ""bad guys"" that've abused his mother his entire life. But let that go and the movie continues to use this well-acted character as a poor plot device.
Next we get to a scene where Sandro is seemingly apologetic and reveals that he's been messaging the antagonist. But do any of the mercenary crew search him for the tactical cell he's been using? No. Let's just recall that one of the ""highly trained spec-ops"" crew is missing their tactical cell, and not one of the crew even thinks to confiscate it from the kid later? Then Sandro who's just admitted that he made a mistake decides to take off and surrender himself to the antagonist, leading to the final standoff.
During the final standoff Sandro, our all important plot device, decides to agreeably wear a suicide vest just to help out the antagonist.
So in conclusion the movie is good, but one character ruins it. Because of the lines and plot put into this one character. I have no dislike towards the actor who did a brilliant job, but the character was not well written enough, and it's a shame that they were forced into being a plot device used to extend the movie by an hour.";6;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur131062286/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9130010/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-18

This is perfectly fine as Chris Hemsworth tries to build a new B-action franchise over on Netflix. The Russo brothers have given Sam Hargrave an opportunity to direct. Sam is a stunt guy and this is most notable for its long action stunt sequences. I would prefer that he leaves the CGI out of his work as much as possible. The prison break section worn me out as the CGI action gets really unreal. It felt fake and I stopped caring. The tower apartment is another story. Sure, there is also CGI and outrageous action, but the apartment tower grounds the action. It felt much more real and therefore much more compelling.

I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.
Highlights:
Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me ball. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.
Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.
The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.
Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.
Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.

At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.
The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147286305/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9032808/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-04
tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;jace_the_film_guy;"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.
While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.
The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.
Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.
""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.

tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;gcsman;"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.
I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.
The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.
At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.";9;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66541531/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9039951/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-07
tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;AfricanBro;"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.
Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.
Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.
I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;breneff;This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.;9;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur71174029/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9030789/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-03

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;georgewhittingham1;"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.
Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)
The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.
This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.
Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.

tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;Mysterygeneration;"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.
Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.
Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;cthirlby;This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.
The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.

From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets.

tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;cardsrock;"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.
In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.
Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more.

tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;Her-Excellency;"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.
Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.
Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.
In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption.

tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;GusherPop;"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too.

tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;rexmatthewj;"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.
The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).
""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""
The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.
The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism.

tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;Chance_Boudreaux19;"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.
Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.
The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.";7;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57999530/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9034419/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-05
tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;brandonmckay8;I just left the cinema & my immediate thoughts was that was quite possibly the best of the Guardians of the Galaxy series & the best MCU film since No Way Home (or possibly endgame) it's definitely one I'll be seeing again! It's a beautifully written film with so much great action sequences, comedic scenes & some really heart touching moments. The backstory for Rocket really messes you up seeing what he went through & how he had to witness all his friends being slaughtered. Although it makes you believe it at times thankfully none of the Guardians actually pass but they do split in an emotional finale. Star-Lord finally decides to stop running & returns home to Earth to see his grand father! The final dance scene was so enjoyable. There are two post credit scenes so make sure to say to the end!;9;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur55625626/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9031744/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-04
tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;MatthewMichaelHoffman;"SCORE: 10/10
James Gunn...you beautiful, beautiful man. Thank you. You inspire me to want to act, you inspire me to want to write and direct, and you inspire me to embrace my creativity and the artist within me. My eyes were glued to the IMAX screen from start to finish, even after having watched the entirety of the first 2 movies as part of a Guardians Marathon in theaters. The stakes were unbelievably high and they just kept increasing in severity. Right off rip we are thrust into a life threatening circumstance with the arrival of Adam Warlock and Rocket's imminent death. Peter is seen drowning his sadness of losing Gamora with alcohol, a parallel to how his buddy Thor was handling his awful life situation. Things were not looking good for the Guardians at all.
On top of all of that, quite possibly the MCU's most ruthless, hate-able villain was about to be introduced. If you had any plan of withholding tears during the movie, bring the box of tissues. You're going to need it. Through exploring Rocket's past, we are exposed to how awful he and the other animals were treated during the High Evolutionary's dangerous experiments. We have to sit there and watch all of Rocket's friends, Lylla, Teefs, and Floor be gunned down right in front of him as he attempts to break them out. Everything from hearing his younger voice to seeing him as a baby set the perfect stage for emotional connection to one of the Guardians' most important members.
How did they manage to make the rating for this movie PG-13? They did abide by the 1 F-word rule, but the violence was intensely gruesome, which I loved. Heads being chopped off, faces being ripped off, and action sequences that were some of the best the MCU has ever seen. With how some projects have been leaning into the ""Marvel fatigue"" that people talk about, this film is by far one of the most ambitious with its choices. It dares to be different, but also gives us that true Guardians of the Galaxy vibe that we all love, something that Quantumania failed to do.
The one small thing that I will say that bothered me was Gamora's character and how I wish they would've gone just a little bit further with some of the emotional moments. Gamora stopping to tell Peter that she ""bets they were fun"" had me about to be a complete wreck, but then it felt like they took the foot off that gas. She stays stubborn til the end, which I can respect, but maybe just had wishfully thinking that she would come around. I'm just happy that no one of great significance dies, and that the LEGENDARY STAR LORD WILL RETURN! One of my favorite characters in the MCU for sure. Thank you James Gunn.
Amendment: My score needs an amendment. This was a perfect movie. Better than the original Guardians? I'm at least open to that idea, but for now I'm going to say no. The way they used Gamora's character grew on me and her ""I bet we were fun"" successfully broke me. They handled her character arc so meticulously and, as I said in my original review, maybe it was just wishful thinking that they would've had her come around fully at the end in some way. I think the first time around I was dealing with the fact that it was the 3rd movie of the night of a 7 and 1/2 marathon that ended at 2:30 AM, I was preparing myself for the biggest presentation of my corporate career, and I was still trying to emotionally recover from having to experience Yondu's death again.";10;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur152799620/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9032502/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-04
tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;donz-8;"I'll keep this review short and simple. Aside from some awkwardly silly jokes and (only sometimes) slightly confusing pace, this was the best installment from the GOTG series. For the first time in a very long while, I really got 'pulled' in to the movie emotionally, something that hasn't happened since ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame"". Since this review requires more ""characters"" I'll just add that GOTG 3 was a perfect finale to the series and I'm looking forward to the ""New Guardians"" (or whatever name they'll be referred to). With all of that being said, Guardians Vol. 3 is, without a doubt, one of the best MCU movies, definitely in the top 5 and well worth the price of admission.";9;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur9759583/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9066717/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-20
tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;ethanbresnett;"I think it's fair to say that since Endgame Marvel's output has been littered with as many misses as hits. After the thoroughly disappointing Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania, Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and James Gunn well and truly delivers with Guardians Vol. 3.
This is easily the most fun I've had with a superhero film in a long time. It is funny, thrilling, and surprisingly emotional. Fans who have been following these characters for the last 10 years, get ready for such a satisfying and emotional journey.
What makes the Guardians so good is that they stand out. Superhero films are becoming far too formulaic and blending into one another, but the Guardians films somehow manage to buck this trend. Sure, the story follows the well trodden superhero film structure at its core and there are lots of familiar cliches and tropes, but the dressing around these things feels vibrant, distinct, and cared for.
The characters remain unique and interesting, with great performances behind them all. I was particularly impressed with Pom Klementieff in this film, who steals the show in my opinion with her emotion and humour. All of the performances are great though, with another shout out to Chukwudi Iwuji for a captivating performance.
The story is full of emotion, and is quite possibly the most emotional and punchy Marvel film yet. It brought me to tears and I could hear plenty of others in the theatre feeling a similar way! It's also really funny too with so many laugh out loud moments. James Gunn excelled himself with this script in every way.
Saying that, I do think some story elements feel a little bit clunky, and some characters are a little surplus to requirements, but these are minor criticisms in the grand scheme of things.
The action sequences are well done. They aren't mind blowing, but much more emphasis is put into story and character than action so this isn't necessarily a bad thing.
I will also say that despite being two and a half hours this film doesn't feel long at all. It never once drags and every scene feels needed and adds something to the whole picture.
Guardians Vol 3. Is fun, emotional, and just a joy to watch. A brilliant return to form for the MCU.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur114450253/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9031312/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-03
tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;Jeremy_Urquhart;"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.
With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.
There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.
But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.
Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.";7;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26226712/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9030699/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-03

tt6791350;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3;simplygk;9 years, 6 movies and one special presentation later... its time to say goodbye to our guardians. The movie was done in typical Guardians style with some kick ass tunes and plenty of laughs but this movie had so much more heart than the previous 2 titles. The story mainly focuses on Rockets backstory, which is absolutely tragic and heartbreaking. The only disappointing thing was Will Poulter as Adam Warlock, he was powerful enough but portrayed as a child and kind of stupid... basically like drax, but less funny. If ypu enjoyed the previous 2 guardians movies then I highly recommend you go check this out.

tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;Rob-O-Cop;"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?
The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.
This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.";3;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15588823/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9005397/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-04-20
tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;dommercaldi;"Pros: 1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.
2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.
3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.
4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.
Cons: 1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.
2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.
3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.
4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.
5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.
6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.
7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.
8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.
9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.
10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?";4;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur96338646/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8834199/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-01-29
tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;fraser-simons;"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.
It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.

tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;Tweetienator;The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces?

The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.
We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat).

tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;JumpingCineFile;"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.
There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.
For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.
The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.
The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.";7;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1333231/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8736368/?ref_=tt_urv;2022-12-15

Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original.

They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?
I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.
So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.
You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.

tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;alfredvankuik;"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.
We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.
For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.
The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.
Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all.

tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;mmarab91;"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.
One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.
Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.
Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.
Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.
In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur150529212/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9112860/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-10

The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!
The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!
I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.
The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.
Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.

tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;fthkgdcc;"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.
The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.
The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.";3;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur131264181/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8934065/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-03-17

There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...

tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;Sam56800;"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.
Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.";3;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34896885/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8739710/?ref_=tt_urv;2022-12-16
tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;shawcarvetht;"I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.
It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.
Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.
Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.

tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;namob-43673;"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.
I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.
I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...";7;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur60195330/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8739471/?ref_=tt_urv;2022-12-16
tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;nik-498-56571;"The first Avatar film was obviously ground-breaking when it came to the visual world, and at the time, this made up for a relatively weak story. 'Unobtanium', really? What an uninspired name for a resource which is difficult to mine.
Anyhow, moving on to this film, I just don't get the whole story... If your tribe are in danger by a known enemy, why on earth would you go and put another tribe in danger by hiding out with them? What a selfish, self-important, arrogant thing to do! It was obvious from the start that eventually they would put that tribe in danger too, but they didn't seem to give a monkeys!
Where on earth did the two sprogs come from? There was absolutely no mention of any of these types of relationships happening in the first film for either Grace or the Colonel . To suddenly have two kids pretty much being the main characters in this film just defies sense or logic, and shows a complete lack of respect for the audience! For anyone justifying these characters by some sort of hidden back story from the first film is just using lazy excuses!
What?? The Colonel is alive and in a avatar body? Again, lazy writing to bring back the antagonist!
I was excited to see this sequel, but feel very let down by a lazy, boring and dull story, trying to ride on the ""Look at the graphics"" selling point. You did that 14 years ago... this time you need a good story!

tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;EvanoOruvan;"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..
Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...
A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!

tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;Jeremy_Urquhart;"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.
As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.
First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.
Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.
Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).
There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.";9;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26226712/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8735171/?ref_=tt_urv;2022-12-14

For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.
When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.
Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.

tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;calle_borve;"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.
Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.
For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.
Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.";3;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur36755518/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8759479/?ref_=tt_urv;2022-12-26
tt1630029;Avatar: The Way of Water;Dory_Darko;"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:
~ The story is paper-thin.
~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.
~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.
~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.
~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.
~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.
And yet.....
IT'S SO DAMN COOL.
The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.
But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...

It's based on a Wattpad novel by Mercedes Ron, which after two back to back watching a of the film I went to order from Amazon (can't wait to read the book(s)).
The film has both a sexy hate to love story and action in the form of both street racing and underground fighting. It is fast-paced and beautiful filmed...leaving no trace me for boredom.
The story is about 17 year old Noah, who is brought by her newly wed mother Rafaella to live in her new stepfather's mega-mansion on the coast. There she must live with an older stepbrother named Nick. Nick's father William thinks he is this perfect golden boy, but Noah discovers that the true reality is that he is a smoking, partying, street racing, underground fighting bad boy, whose life gets Noah in trouble.
What Nick doesn't know is that his angsty beautiful new stepsister has a troubled past and a few secrets of her own.
These two clash in an epic passionate way and it was an enjoyable ride to watch.

(Thanks in large part to the actors and their commitment to love scenes as well as their clear overall enjoyment together). You won't be able to resist the charm and intense sexuality of every scene they share together. Nick and Noah are drawn together slowly in part due to their mutual attraction but also as they discover more about each other's difficult pasts. Finally a brooding character who is NOT controlling and actually has a laugh with his on-screen love! Other YA adaptations could learn a lot from this.
I also enjoyed the scenes of the parents. Believable performances from everyone, including the two other guys who crush on Noah in the film. There are also heavy nods to the Fast and Furious franchise, but it plays strongly into the wild traits of Noah and Nick so it's inspired to elevate the romantic journey rather than blandly copying the action series.

tt21909764;Culpa mía;aliceisangry;"Overall it's not a terrible movie, there were some major downfalls along with successes throughout. Keep in mind that this movie is based on a young adult trilogy and therefore there are quite a bit of clichés along with taboo topics utilized within the plot. I have not read this book series and am only basing my review on the film.
The film starts out with Noah and her mother moving in with their new family, in a huge mansion along the beach. Keep in mind that Noah is 17, and has a lot of past trauma from her father so she is not as welcoming to this new family as she is young with a lot of growing up to do. Some viewers might see her behavior as bratty, but to be fair she is a teenager that has been completely uprooted from her life that she grew comfortable within.
Nicholas is also young, 22 I think, and he is portrayed as this Casanova. Shortly into the film it is revealed that he is the leader of this gang that races cars, holds underground fights, and raging parties. While his trauma is never fully developed, it is suggested to be based around his mother who abandoned him when she divorced his father. Despite this, he has a loving brotherly relationship with his half sister who has diabetes.
The beginning of the film starts out at a great pace, with great development of the hateful relationship between the step siblings and the love between Nicholas' father and Noah's mother. As the film progresses there are large time gaps that are attempted to be filled by mere words revealed by one of the characters within a conversation. The film soon solely focuses on Noah and Nicholas with random scenes sprinkled in of other characters. The supporting characters soon feel lost in the film.
The main dilemma within this film stems from Noah's trauma caused by her father. While the viewer gets snippets of what happened throughout the film, there is still many essential pieces of information lost. I wonder if there will be a second film following the plot of the book trilogy that will reveal more about Noah's family's past as she copes with her father's death.
While there were issues with the plot and the depth of the character's backstories, the overall chemistry, which seems to be the main focus of the film, between Nicholas and Noah is portrayed well.
So if you like cliché young adult films with taboo themes, give this film a watch, I'm sure it won't dissapoint.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur165295612/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9120736/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-14

tt21909764;Culpa mía;lavatch;"It is shocking to think that ""My Fault"" (Culpa Mia) would be a featured film on Amazon Prime. While such literary giants as Jane Austen, Shakespeare, and Lorca are mentioned in the film, the audience is treated to nothing but trash.
The main plot is that of a young man named Nick who falls in love with his 17-year-old stepsister named Noah! The setting is that of a fantasy island-like paradise where young Noah is instantly repelled, then inexplicably madly in love with her stepbrother Nick. All the while, Noah's mother is asking questions to her new millionaire husband like, ""What dress should I wear tonight?""
Most of the film unfolds as a comedy with the whirlwind romance backed up by dare-devil auto races, madcap parties, fist fighting, and people being thrown into swimming pools. Then, suddenly, the tone shifts when Noah's deranged father is let out of prison and makes a bee-line to kill his own daughter!

I watched it because I saw a lot of people say it was a great movie and I do like the forbidden love kinda thing. I haven't read the book but I will guess the story is pretty much the same and omg it's so cliche like, she's different from other girls, she needs a library to read all her books, of course she is super good at riding cars, and not only that she also has traumas so her bad boy step brother can comfort her whenever she gets a little random ptsd. Also it doesn't make sense that the bad boy that has a lot of girls falls for his annoying rude little step sister?? He didn't even try to get to know her as a sister he literally just fell in love out of nothing and starting punching people when they said something about her like they literally told each other two words and he already like that . It's like a thousand bad watt pad stories put in one movie.
So yea the story is pretty bad, teenagers don't really even act like that and I stopped watching when she got missing because I already know he gonna comfort her and he was probably gonna cry or sum.

tt21909764;Culpa mía;OceanGirl941;"There's no other way to kick this review off than to say ¡muy caliente!
I'm so grateful for Spanish and Latin American (and other countries as well) movies and series. This would have been butchered in the hands of American production companies. They're too repressed by film award constructs and bizarre moral codes that only apply to Hollywood.
But I digress, and feel better having gotten that off of my chest.
I've learned within the past few hours that this movie was an adaptation from a Wattpad novel, which is also available on Kindle. I just made that purchase, because it was that good. In fact, I'm off to start reading when I'm done here. EDIT/UPDATE, I'm loving the novel.
The chemistry between Guevara and Wallace was very close to the level of passion of Maite Perroni and Alejandro Speitzer of Osculo Deseo (aka ""Dark Desire""). Though this is quite a bit more modest. I do see the potential for more sizzle in the (hopefully) movies for the next two novels.
I loved Nick's complexities and the writing was perfectly paced to reveal why.
Ditto with the writing for Noah. I love that name by the way.
The character development for the relationship was well paced.
The hate to love tension between Nick and Noah was perfect.
Guevara is an expert kisser (very rare, icydk) and he brought the fricking heat. Once you have had that kind of passion in your life, you easily recognize it wherever else you see it. I definitely recognized it here. So, from the scene at the first party, when Nick grabbed a girl and kissed her, I knew. It was absolutely sinful, in the best way possible. I even spoke out loud a phrase that I can't write here. It's THAT rare. ❤❤❤
The cast were exceptional and there were no mismatches anywhere. From the leads to the supporting cast, all the way down to the mansion staff here and there, everyone contributed to its success.
The movie was visually stunning. Cameras were perfect, even in the car race scenes. That final car chase scene on the dock was fire!
Loved the wardrobes.
Everyone did a fantastic job of putting this together. It had me spellbound from beginning to end. I'm looking forward to more.
This is a hit, another bragging right for Spain.

tt5971474;The Little Mermaid;TomTalksFilms;"You'd think a company like Disney with the amount of money and resources that they have to draw upon would be able to develop some original ideas but no nope, here's another live action remake. The biggest issue straight out of the gate is that much like pretty much all these live action remakes is that it didn't need to be made. If I want to watch any of the films that have been re made then 9 times out of 10 I'm going to watch the original animation, they're just classics with heart that can't be re created in live action. That being said this film exists and I have limitless so may as well watch it.
Another big issue I had with this film is the pacing, it's a 2hrs 15 mins kids film and with the attention span that kids have today even if it was well paced kids would be bored by the end. This film to me felt like it had a lot of filler particularly once (spoiler) Arial gets her legs in the second act and none of it was that interesting. For me the film didn't add anything that would have made the animation better if it had been in there. That being said this film isn't a total loss, Halle Bailey (not Halle Berry 🐱) is great as arial, when she hits the high note in part of your world I couldn't help but be amazed. In fact that song was probably the stand out scene of the film for me, it was brilliantly recreated.
Bailey is also forced to convey the emotion of her character for a large part of the film just with her eyes and she does a great job of it. I also felt Melisa McCarthy was great as Ursula although I felt her character was underused in what was ultimately an anti-climatic final act. I do want to give a special to mention to Javier Bardem as he gives probably the flattest performance of his entire career as a King Triton.

Halle Bailey as Ariel was good and Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was passable but beside those two, all of the other characters felt virtually nonexistent with zero chemistry with one another.
Visually, the remake falls short in creating a believable underwater world. The CGI effects were uninspiring and more importantly, looked cheap.
What 'The Little Mermaid' suffered from the most was the god awful script. The pacing was uneven, scenes dragged on or failed to contribute to the overall narrative, and the characters felt shallow and lacked depth.
Overall, the 2023 remake was lackluster and forgettable. The uninspiring performances, poor visual effects, and terrible original songs left me disengaged and disappointed. Don't let the positive reviews the film has been receiving gaslight you into thinking that these awful cash grab live-action remakes that Disney has been producing are okay.

The most shocking in this film is the visual incoherence between the ocean world and the human world. The ocean is all horrible cgi hair and crazy psychedelic colors but it feels like a proper universe. On the other hand the human world is insanely cheap looking, a green screen studio Bridgerton with questionable colonial undertones. The market scene is appalling, so shiny and weirdly modern looking as if you were in a themed tourist trap. The studio lighting makes all the actors look like soap opera extras. I feel so bad for the Eric actor who had to deliver that embarrassing solo that reaches the highest levels of camp. And the edit is so stiff, the acting so stilted it seems the director was inspired by Gone With the Wind.

His out of the water shots had the whole cinema laughing as you could just imagine him shooting them in a tiny pool trying to look serious with that hobo beard and cheesy shell outfit.

However, during the film I nearly feel asleep half way through as did the other guests who attended with me.

tt5971474;The Little Mermaid;phantasmda;"I took my seven year old to see this last night and she was fine for the first half hour or so and then she became really bored with it. After about an hour and 20 minutes she was asking if we could leave and do something else, that's not a good sign when even young girls don''t like this film.
From my own personal point of view, the film is way too long for kids, the songs are borderline horrific, seriously, whoever thought putting a rap song in a film like the little mermaid was a good idea needs to be sectioned, talk about butchering a classic film score.
The special effects, all I can say is, how has a film with a budget this big been made to look so poor, some of the underwater scenes look like something from a playstation 2 cut scene, they're awful.
The animal characters in this, Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder are dreadful, they look freaky, not cartoonish or charming, not even realistic, just weird and odd and they really take you out of the film whenever they're on screen.
The performances are fine, no one in this is terrible but the script and the songs they're working with are so sub par that anyone would struggle with it.
I remember, even as a young boy, watching the original Little Mermaid and being absolutely mesmerised by it, where as this one, is dull, boring and lifeless and not just my own daughter, but other peoples kids in the cinema were fidgeting, squirming and complaining at around the 90 minute make of this.
It's far too long to keep most kids entertained and it's not pretty or charming enough to hold their attention for any length of time.
Save your money and take your kids to a theme park or an activity center, they'll have a much better time.";1;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13386459/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9081643/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-27
tt5971474;The Little Mermaid;tm-sheehan;"My Review - The Little Mermaid My Rating- 9/10
At long last a Disney live action feature film reimagining of a much loved previous animated Disney classic that's not a dud like the recent Pinocchio and Dumbo .
The Little Mermaid is a triumph for Director Rob Marshall who's previous film treatments of musicals like Chicago 2002 Into The Woods 2014 and Disney's Mary Poppins Returns 2018 I've completely forgiven him for his treatment of Nine in 2005.
All the cast in The Little Mermaid shines like the beam from a Lighthouse but the shining star in my view is Halle Bailey as Ariel the mermaid who longs to experience what life is like on land with the Prince she rescues from drowning.
Halle Bailey's debut in this estimated $200million musical feature movie is inspired as she is a relatively little known star name but I'm confident that this movie will change that .
Halle's casting and performance in The Little Mermaid reminded me of two other examples of relatively little known actresses who were perfectly cast in their roles they are two Marias's Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music and more recently Rachel Zegler in West Side Story.
The original score by composers Alan Menken and Howard Ashman with much-loved composers Alan Menken and Howard Ashman plus four new songs, with lyrics by Hamilton composer Lin - Manuel Miranda all add to the spectacle .
My favourites are the three great numbers Part of Your World sung beautifully by Halle Bailey ,Poor Unfortunate Souls with additional lyrics by Lin - Manuel Miranda sung and performed with devilish delight by Melissa McCarthy .
Of course the great production number Under The Sea earns a screen credit for the famous Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation who came on board to assist Rob Marshall it truly is a triumph of live action and stunning animation.
The rest of the featured cast includes Jonah Hauer-King as the handsome Prince Eric who impresses Ariel enough to rescue him and save his life . Lin -Manuel Miranda's new song for him to sing Wild Uncharted Waters fits into the plot beautifully and is well sung.
The two well known box office stars are Melissa McCarthy as Ursula the Sea Witch enchantress who bewitches Ariel stealing her voice but granting her legs to enter the human world. Special mention must be made at this point to praise the superb costumes worn by Ursula, all the mermaids ,King Triton and all the human cast members of The Little Mermaid that are beautifully designed by Colleen Atwood a four time Oscar Winner.
Ariel has only 3 sunsets to win the love of Prince Eric with a kiss or return to the sea and become her slave .
Javier Bardem is commanding in his role as King Triton Ariel's kind but strict father who's sister Ursula wants to crush him in revenge for her banishment with her tentacles.
I found the CGI special effects very impressive perhaps a little dark in parts but equal to anything I've seen recently.
This updated version depicts Ariel in a much more contemporary way her whole interest is not merely romantic this version shows the heroine as an independent young woman who rejects the suspicion and resentment of the human world that her protective father expresses to keep her from leaving her safe home under the sea .
There's all the fun still in this movie from Ariel's sea friends Scuttle the seagull ,Sebastian the Jamaican crab and flounder .
Much of the outdoor Film location took place on Santa Teresa di Gallura on Sardinia's northern coast.
This is a movie I think for all audiences young and older perhaps a little scary for very young children as it has some dark scary moments .
I loved The Little Mermaid please see it in its Cinema release don't wait till September or October when it will be streamed by Disney Plus.";9;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25552762/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9076892/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-25
tt5971474;The Little Mermaid;krisssannn;I'll start with this, Halle Bailey was fantastic. She was cast perfectly as Ariel with her tender voice and childlike charm. I think the entire cast did well given what they had to work with. My issue is that in most cases I feel these live action remakes are not able to capture the essence of their original counterparts. Little Mermaid is no exception, it was fun and colorful to watch but again I felt like something was missing. By the second half of the film I was counting down the time I'd be able to get to my bed. The film just never connected with me. And I almost feel like I would have been perfectly fine without this remake.;6;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur165120589/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9078357/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-26

The CGI is poorly done and the tone of the film is dark and gloomy, not bright and colorful as it should be.
The animal characters look terrible. The changes to the songs are ridiculous, the original lyrics weren't problematic in the slightest.
Scuttle's voice is really jarring and the added song is just bad.
The changes made to the ending make the story worse, not better. They didn't need to make Eric weaker to build up Ariel.

tt5971474;The Little Mermaid;MatthewMichaelHoffman;"SCORE: 10/10
My heart is so full right now. After all the backlash and criticism this film received before it had even come out, it delivered one of the best live action remakes that has ever been put to screen. As I was watching, it became more and more clear what the task at hand was for the people that made this movie, and how they over delivered in virtually every aspect possible. The animated version was amazing, but there is something that animation allows you to do with the storytelling and character development that just wouldn't make sense in live action. All of this talk about how ""awful"" Sebastian and Flounder looked compared to the animation doesn't matter because it just works, so much to the point where I actually enjoy this version a lot more.
This version of The Little Mermaid takes all the awesome moments, dialogue, and songs from the original and adds a modern flavor to it. Even the new songs were great, with the Scuttle song in the style of Lin-Manuel Miranda being a nice, entertaining surprise. The pacing was perfect and it knew exactly how much time to spend on each part of the story, not overextending at all. It understands comedic timing so well, and the casting choices for Ursula and Sebastian were genius. This version of Sebastian was top tier and Melissa McCarthy brings her all. Kiss the Girl is one of my favorite Disney songs ever and I was dying with laughter watching Sebastian sing from under the hat. Gosh I just loved everything about this movie. Jonah Hauer-King is a wonderful Eric and complements the performance given by the woman who deserves the world.
This last paragraph is dedicated to Halle Bailey. What a beautiful, talented, special human being. Her portrayal of Ariel is what really drives this entire movie and her voice is so amazing. I don't care if this is taken as a hot take, but she should totally be up for an Oscar for her performance. It takes so much courage to understand the backlash she would receive for the closed minded, bigoted people that inhabit this earth and deliver an unbelievable performance like she did. It wasn't just what she did with her voice, but how she was able to enhance the story during her scenes where she couldn't use her voice. A true superstar that needs to be protected at all costs.";10;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur152799620/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9076218/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-25
tt5971474;The Little Mermaid;rexmatthewj;"The Little Mermaid (2023) is a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1989 animated classic, which was loosely based on the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. The movie follows the story of Ariel, a curious and adventurous mermaid who falls in love with Prince Eric, a human she rescues from a shipwreck. To be with him, she makes a deal with Ursula, a wicked sea witch who takes her voice in exchange for human legs. Ariel must win Eric's heart before the time runs out, or else she will lose her soul to Ursula.
The movie is directed by Rob Marshall, who has previously helmed musicals such as Chicago, Into the Woods and Mary Poppins Returns. The screenplay is written by David Magee, who also worked on Finding Neverland and Life of Pi. The music is composed by Alan Menken, who returns to score the film and write new songs with Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of Hamilton and Moana.
The cast of the movie features newcomers and veterans alike. Halle Bailey stars as Ariel, making her feature film debut after being discovered by Beyoncé and appearing in the musical duo Chloe x Halle. Jonah Hauer-King plays Prince Eric, a British actor who has appeared in TV shows such as Little Women and World on Fire. Melissa McCarthy portrays Ursula, the iconic villainess who has a penchant for collecting souls and singing showstoppers. Javier Bardem plays King Triton, Ariel's father and the ruler of the underwater kingdom of Atlantica. Daveed Diggs, Awkwafina and Jacob Tremblay lend their voices to Sebastian, Scuttle and Flounder, Ariel's loyal friends and sidekicks. Noma Dumezweni plays Queen Selina, Eric's mother and a new character created for the film.
The movie aims to modernize the classic tale for a new generation of audiences, while staying faithful to the spirit of the original. The movie features new scenes and characters that explore the cultures and backgrounds of Ariel and Eric, as well as their relationship and motivations. The movie also updates some of the songs and dialogue to reflect more contemporary sensibilities and humor.
The movie is a feast for the eyes and ears, with stunning visuals and catchy tunes that will enchant viewers of all ages. The movie showcases the beauty and diversity of the ocean world, as well as the charm and splendor of the human realm. The movie also boasts impressive performances from the cast, especially Bailey, who brings a fresh and captivating take on Ariel. She sings with grace and power, expressing Ariel's longing and joy with every note. McCarthy also delivers a memorable turn as Ursula, who is both menacing and hilarious in her schemes and songs.
However, the movie is not without its flaws. Some of the changes made to the story may not sit well with fans of the original animation or the fairy tale source material. Some of the new scenes and characters feel unnecessary or underdeveloped, while some of the old ones are altered or omitted for no apparent reason. The movie also suffers from some uneven pacing and editing, as well as some questionable choices in cinematography and visual effects. Some of the creature designs are also less than appealing or realistic, especially compared to other recent Disney live-action remakes.
The Little Mermaid (2023) is a fun and entertaining musical fantasy that pays homage to its beloved predecessor while adding some new twists and flavors. It may not be perfect or groundbreaking, but it is a worthy addition to Disney's live-action canon that will surely delight fans old and new.";6;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur122459646/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9079025/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-26
tt5971474;The Little Mermaid;Ajaquai;"The latest in Disney's attempt to cash in on all their old IPs instead of making something new and originals has finally hit the screens and it's bad.
A far cry from the bright captivating colors of the original, this ocean is dark and muted. Have the animators even visited a coral reef before? Or are they just trying to hide imperfect CGI by just turning down the color and brightness? Perhaps they should watch Avatar 2 to see how to do a live action amazing underwater world right. The live action aspect actively hurts the film due to making the non-human characters unexpressive at best, uncanny valley at worst.
The run time is bloated, and although they have added some extra things in to fill the time, you kind of wish on the whole that they didn't. The rap song is particularly awful and doesn't feel like it fits at all with the rest of the music in the film.
Like many that have gone before, there's no particular reason for this live action remake to exist apart from being nostalgia bait. Give it a miss and watch the original instead.

I enjoyed Sebastian and Ursula, but overall I regretted going to see this. I have never walked out of a movie before, but this one tempted me to leave multiple times.

tt5971474;The Little Mermaid;Entertainmentsparadise;"The underwater adventure presents a captivating visual spectacle infused with the melodious talents of Ms. Ariel, portrayed by Halle Bailey. The live-action adaptation of The Little Mermaid is a stunning production that impeccably captures the essence of the characters while incorporating a touch of uniqueness.
The initial scenes build up anticipation as every character is introduced, except for our beloved Ariel. The film skillfully incorporates Halle Bailey's enchanting voice in the background, staying true to the allure of the mermaid's siren song. Halle Bailey shines brilliantly, much like the sun reflecting on the ocean, with her gentle interpretation of the character. A delightful PG love story unfolds between Ariel and the Prince, one that is sure to captivate audiences.
Although Sebastian and Flounder appear more realistic than anything else in the film, the voice actors are well-cast, and Sebastian, in particular, brings a comical appeal to the story. The movie strikes a balance with ample drama and effectively utilizes music, ensuring that it feels like a complete cinematic experience rather than solely a musical. The songs are delightful and showcase the vocal range of the singers, including Ariel.
All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, appreciating its diverse elements. Halle's portrayal of Ariel and her captivating appearance was genuinely stunning. It's a delightful experience for both the younger audience and families, as well as those who cherish a well-crafted Disney movie.

tt5971474;The Little Mermaid;Carycomic;"I was hoping that they wouldn't. But, they did! Disney made a half-live action/half-CGI remake of the film that launched their Great Renaissance in the late Eighties/Early Nineties. And it was just as I feared.
It was more lackluster than blockbuster.
Javier Bardem was suitably convincing as the temperamental King Triton. And Hallie Bailey (which, to be honest, sounds more like a stage name hodge-podged from Halle Berry and Pearl Bailey ) was suitably charming as Ariel. Although, only with the spoken dialogue. Because her rendition of the songs sounded more like she was lip-synching to the Jodi Benson originals. Just as Melissa McCarthy sounded more like she was lip-synching to Pat Carroll's songs as the original Ursula!
Then there were the needless attempts at character ""development."" Like making Ursula and Triton estranged siblings; or making Prince Eric an adopted son. What was even the point of the latter? Because all that made me do is think: ""Are Ariel and Eric going to be ret-conned as long-lost twins?!""

It pained me to see one of my favorite characters portrayed with such little depth and emotion. It felt as though Disney had taken a wrong turn, losing the essence and magic that made their animated classics so enchanting.
The entire film seemed to lack the sparkle and imagination that Disney is renowned for. The updated storyline and visual effects failed to capture the same whimsy and charm as the original animated masterpiece. It's as if the underwater world I once adored had lost its vibrant colors, leaving behind a bland and lifeless rendition.
As I reflect on ""The Little Mermaid"" (2023), it's with a heavy heart that I give it a single star. This adaptation fell short of capturing the spirit and magic that made the original so timeless.

The premise of the little mermaid is a simple one, and if you watch disney's 1989 animated version today, you'll see that they leaned really reallyyyy heavily into fairytale tropes... the most obvious one being they myth that a fleeting, superficial attraction = true love.
I loved this 2023 remake of the little mermaid bc it strengthens this central theme of the story. Ariel doesn't fall in love w eric bc he's a hot prince. This film makes a point to develop eric's character, to present eric and ariel as complex characters: two young, brave people on the precipice of life w helicopter parents who keep thwarting their plans for adventure. Every character in this film is very well developed, even their parents.
Some of y'all just hate live action remakes, and you should just say that. We get it, animation is fun... you miss seeing magical animals w big disney eyes-it's what makes these fairytale/kids movies instant classics.

The songs are stale and uninspired, the special effects department did okay, the actors did okay, but well, the formula of Disney movies is now a walking dead corpse, too many times chewed on.

The Little Mermaid showcases the beloved tale in a fresh and captivating way, with stunning visuals that bring the underwater world to life. The CGI is seamless, creating a truly immersive experience that surpassed my expectations.
In this adaptation of The Little Mermaid, we follow the enchanting journey of Ariel (Halle Bailey), a young mermaid who longs to explore the human world. The film stays true to the heart of the original story, emphasizing themes of self-discovery, love and the importance of staying true to oneself.
The Little Mermaid delivers exceptional performances, breathtaking visuals, and captivating storytelling. Halle Bailey performs remarkably, capturing Ariel's curiosity, spirit, and powerful voice. Casting a Black actress in the iconic role of Ariel is a decisive step toward diversifying the portrayal of princesses on screen. It offers young audiences, particularly Black girls who have rarely seen themselves in mainstream media, a chance to see a character they can deeply identify with, and I love that! The cast is rounded out with renowned actors who bring depth and charm to their respective roles. Tony winner Daveed Diggs gives a comedic, clever and heartfelt performance as Sebastian the Crab. Awkwafina's delightful portrayal of Scuttle the Seagull and Jonah Hauer-King's as Prince Eric brilliantly captures the original characters' essence while bringing their unique charm and charisma to the roles. They skillfully breathe new life into these beloved characters, adding depth and memorable moments that both longtime fans and new audiences will appreciate. The costumes, designed by Colleen Atwood, beautifully capture the underwater kingdom and the human world above. The music score by the talented duo of Oscar winner Alan Menken and Tony winner Lin-Manuel Miranda is magical, seamlessly blending Menken's enchanting melodies with Miranda's vibrant and rhythmic compositions, resulting in an unforgettable and captivating musical experience.
The Little Mermaid carries a powerful message of self-acceptance, courage and pursuing one's dreams. It promotes positive social behavior and portrays relationships built on understanding and empathy.
I give The Little Mermaid 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 12, plus adults. It releases in theaters on May 26, 2023.

The musical numbers needed more support visually. The first ""Part of Your World"" rendition lacks visual flourish while the Prince Eric solo needs to be supported by big musical instruments. Poor, Unfortunate Souls and Kiss The Girl are good.

The film starts off with a great opening scene then goes back a day prior to explain what is occurring. I really like the setting of this being in an apartment, as it gives the film more dread. I also love how the children give a back story/urban legend explanation then find the hidden book in a really cool way. I guess I wanted more if this back story, as it's really cool.
The movie then goes pretty break neck and carnage ensues. The character development isn't great, so I didn't really care that they were all in this awful situation. The acting is good for sure, especially the mother, she makes the film.
There's a lot of blood in this flick, and maybe I watch too many horrymovies, but I wanted this to be more brutal with gore. Blood and gore are different to me, just to clarify. Anyway, when I found out this was initially made to be released via streaming, it made more sense.
I think there's a good movie in here, but it fell flat for me. I loved the 2013 reboot, so maybe my expectations were off.

The entire movie is so loud and bombastic. You could say the same about the violence. It's brutal. I love that they take full advantage of the R-rating. It doesn't hold back. I liked all of the kill scenes and carnage.
So why didn't I like this more? I have no idea. I was having a decent time. But I wasn't fully engaged or attached. My mind wandered a couple times.

tt13345606;Evil Dead Rise;Darkside-Reviewer;"I went into this Evil Dead film with low expectations especially after being disappointed by other recent horror movie sequels like Halloween Ends, Scream VI and Hellraiser (2022). My expectations were apparently not low enough though as I was thoroughly disappointed by this movie.
This new addition to the Evil Dead universe is easily the most tame and least frightening of the franchise. The original Evil Dead trilogy starring (Bruce Campbell) was the perfect mix of horror, dark humour, excessive levels of gore and a likeable lead character who tied it all together with the help of his chainsaw and boomstick. Even the (2013) Evil Dead reboot movie had some fun and interesting ideas which while not anything particularly ground breaking still gave fans a ton of gory kills and passable enough characters that don't leave you with a headache between their deaths.
Evil Dead Rise fails to bring anything original or even of any value to the Evil Dead franchise. The main cast of characters are mostly teenagers who are written as mere plot devices to move the story forward. A good example of this is one particular character wants to become a DJ so he has a record mixing turntable set up in his room. This is the characters defining characteristic which exists so he has an excuse to play a record of a priest reading a passage from the book of the dead raising the deadites. That's all the character development there is for this character until he dies. The other main characters have very little back story or defining characteristics other than they are all related to each other.
The deadites in this Evil Dead movie are tame in comparison to the previous Evil Dead movies and the TV series. The lead deadite shown in all the trailers for the movie is the mother of the child characters in the movie and we watch as she becomes possessed and hunts her family down to turn them into deadites aswell. Unfortunately however the lead deadite spends most of it's time on screen screaming incoherently, falling over or saying cheesy one liners. When the killing does begin there are some moments that are fun and gory such as a deadite eating a guys eyeball out of his eyesocket only for it to be followed by something as stupid as her spitting the eyeball out and it just so happens to land in another characters mouth choking him to death in a shot that looks less Evil Dead and more Tales from the Crypt. This was clearly an attempt to copy a similar scene from Evil Dead 2 only without the dark comedy that made the scene work in the first place.
The special effects range from practical effects mixed with CGI that look surprisingly well done if not entirely original in design to a CGI mess that looks so unrealistic and fake it takes you right out of a scene that's supposed to hook you in with its suspense.
The absolute worst thing about this movie however is that it takes place in a run down appartment building filled with other tenants but only the people on the top floor of the appartment building are attacked by the deadites or are even aware of the chaos that goes on in the building over just one night. In the span of a few hours the building is affected by a significant earthquake that literally cracks a hole in the buildings foundations, the elevator gets filled with blood and destroyed flooding the elevator shaft and the ground floor with mass amounts of blood, the stairs in the building are completely destroyed, there are screams and even gunshots in the building at least ten people die and through all of that the other people in the building just simply don't let it interrupt their fine evening at home. This might seem like an odd thing to point out but the movie even shows a character who lives in the building the morning after the massacre saying they had trouble sleeping due to a thunder storm that night nothing else just the thunder not the mass murder or anything.
I really don't recommend paying to watch this movie in cinemas it really isn't worth the price of a ticket to watch a movie that is only worthy of being on a streaming service like Hulu or Shudder at best. The movie insults Evil Dead fans by simply doing just the bare minimum necessary for it to qualify as an Evil Dead movie.
The reviews for Evil Dead Rise say things like ""Overwhelmingly scary"" and ""The best Evil Dead since the original"" whoever wrote these reviews have either been paid to praise this movie or they have never seen a horror movie in their entire life and are the kind of people who would get scared watching a Paranormal Activity movie.";4;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur100147162/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9009031/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-04-21
tt13345606;Evil Dead Rise;jfgibson73;I was disappointed. The Evil Dead movies always had simple stories, but this one feels like there is even less going on than usual. A family gets trapped in a building and deadites stalk them. Nothing really creative or memorable happens. I didn't even feel any tension, let alone actual fear. It really seems like the wrong person made this movie--I don't think they know what makes a good horror movie, and they definitely don't deserve to helm an Evil Dead movie. It's more like a low-level slasher sequel than an entry in one of horror's more consistent series. Also, the callbacks were lame. And as for the big finale? It was done better in the recent Color Out of Space. Very skippable.;3;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15795433/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9069554/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-21
tt13345606;Evil Dead Rise;BA_Harrison;"After all the hype, the rave reviews, the revealing trailers, and the silly reaction videos (God, how I hate those), Evil Dead Rise turns out to be exactly what I expected: a serviceable sequel, nothing more, nothing less. Like the remake before it, it delivers on the gore, but is lacking in originality and likeable characters.
The film takes place in a rundown apartment building, home to single mother Ellie (Alyssa Sutherland) and her three obnoxious brats, Bridget (Gabrielle Echols), Danny (Morgan Davies) and Kassie (Nell Fisher). After an earthquake hits the area, Danny discovers a secret vault below the building's underground car park where he finds an ancient book and three old records. Playing the discs unleashes an ancient evil that possesses his mother and spreads to other people in the building. On hand to protect the kids and fight the evil is Ellie's sister Beth (Lily Sullivan).
Writer/director Lee Cronin conducts matters in a workmanlike manner, ladling on the blood and slime, killing off characters that might reasonably be expected to survive many a horror movie, and throwing in a few nods to the original movies to appease long-time fans of all things Evil Dead (I particularly enjoyed the EDII flying eyeball scene); unfortunately, the film wastes its promising locale by confining most of the action to one apartment and doesn't generate much in the way of atmosphere or genuine scares (I didn't jump once).
What the film sorely needed was more imagination and creativity (in both story and direction), and characters that I could actually care about -- exactly the qualities that still make the original film the best of the franchise.
5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.";6;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0945066/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9008970/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-04-21
tt13345606;Evil Dead Rise;statuskuo;"A valiant effort was given to reboot a franchise to which I stopped watching after the original 3. People would consider that canon and the rest just derivative. I've not seen the others though I've seen clips and they seem very anemic. When the original popped onto the screen, it was done with such low rent glee and raw force by director Sam Raimi, that the audience felt the craft behind the filmmaker. Here, the movie is polished to a gloss.
The story is of two sisters, one who returns back to Los Angeles to meet up with a distanced sister who has three kids. L. A. Sister supplements her living with presumably tattoo artistry (how hipster of them). The three kids are aged 14 to 6 (I think). They have their own idiosyncrasies. One seems to want to be a DJ. One is a gothy girl who seems to have questions of her sexuality. The youngest is a tow-headed blonde who is movie adorable. All seem to be oblivious to their lot in life. Which is fine, since L. A. Sister is about to be evicted from her re-purposed old bank home. The production design here probably requires another look to see the neat former bank things.
Clearly this isn't Los Angeles, since it rarely rains. Here, it is pouring.
Any way, the building also seems to house random oddballs but kind ones which seem to fit L. A. Sister and her sleeves of tattoos. Groupie Sister who visits has been away following a band of some kind. Not sure the estrangement and you never get a sense of why their distance, but it doesn't play. Never mind that, because there is an earthquake that opens the Earth to a hole in the ground in the garage. Where the Son (presumably the oldest) goes down and finds...The Book Of The Dead! Seems this should be the reveal in which legacy viewers, such as myself, throw up their hands in excitement. Nope. Fell flat. And also, what ultimately happens to them doesn't have that sense that they deserve such brutality foisted upon them. It felt cruel. There should've been a pause of humanity between sisters before the chipper took her out (what's that doing in an apartment parking lot in L. A.?)
The incantations are read through some vinyl that the Son finds. Since he is a DJ, naturally he plays it which awakens the book. Chaos ensues. And...boy was I bored.
The L. A. Sister is possessed. And then attacks her family. I want to believe that the moviemakers here wanted us to feel the dread. Not really. I felt the people were too dumb to figure out that the grey skinned person is obviously out to kill them. Most notable irritating person is the littlest Blonde kid. Man was she obnoxious. Having seen her Mom die, resurrected THEN kill everyone in the hallway, naturally she wants to open the door. Ugh.
The Groupie Sister sustains horrific violence on her and yet...things like having a glass shard through her hand doesn't have her react that much. Or having a cheese grater across her calf just gives her a limp. If this were done as camp, I would love it. But the music and their reaction doesn't indicate that. It falls flat. The characters reactions to ANYTHING seemed misplaced or just flat out wrong. You see supernatural things, you expect the characters to run. So many stick around and you just wish the demons would just end them all.
The Goth Daughters multiple deaths and attempts to kill seem like it should be more fun. Having the broken end of a wooden pole go through her throat seemed like a good idea, but they linger on her removing it that I grew bored...again.
Perhaps I'm just more charmed by the low-fi version of the originals. And the terrific mugging of Bruce Campbell that this felt less like a ""Evil Dead"" flick and more like a standard Blumhouse B. S. To be clear, I also didn't watch any of the television series. Any and all of them.
I wanted to feel a tinge of nostalgia for the Sam Raimi touch. You saw a little of that in the last ""Doctor Strange"" flick. Here, they elected to go very by the book.
While it's true they can't keep doing ""Cabin In The Woods"" level nonsense (in fact, they fool you into believing that is what was going to happen). The ideal of a metropolitan area where the entire building has zero foot traffic is a hard leap of logic that is too much to bear.
The concept was good, but it doesn't surprise me that this was originally suppose to be straight to streaming. It felt like it. While the effects were solid and the gore was plentiful it still felt REALLY cheap. Perhaps not having any stars gives that impression.
I knew what I was expecting going in, and purposely lowered my standards ahead, but it still did not prepare me to be so disappointed.";4;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur12906670/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9009030/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-04-21

2. The Dilapidated Apartment Building Setup was Perfect However..........
Problems with this Film -
1. As Mentioned, Maybe 30 Minutes after the Main Woman Gets Possessed, the Stakes are Stagnant as Hell.
2. They Don't Give us the audience enough time to Build With the Main Woman and so when she gets Possessed, you don't give a damn about her. She's just the Evil Lady Now.
3. They should of had all kinds of Characters in that Apartment and Some of the Characters, the Audience should actually Care About. Apart from the Little Girl, you don't give a Damn about these Characters.

To add, I was wondering around 30 minutes about the sex of the ""DJ"".... Need to check on Imdb lol. Second, a 4-5 years old as a bad ass looked pretty bad. Terrible idea.
Third, the original and even the remake, had a great script and a great execution. Here everything looked overacted. Even the CGI effects looked cheap and the excessive gore doesn't improve the lack of intensity or interest.
Last, the old building as the main setting does not work here. Best scenes are the opening ones in the cabin. They should have continued from there.

I was a little bummed though there's still no Ash in this one but I still enjoyed it.
The evil dead movies have left the woods and bring their bloodthirsty spirits to Los Angeles in an apartment building where a woman is raising her kids alone. One of the kids finds the book of the dead and decides messing around with it is a good idea. Enter the younger sister of the single mom who plays pretty much the go between trying to hold the family together once the kid finds out things should be left alone for a reason.
There's some good, gooey make up effects and some thrills here. You've seen it all before but even fans of 1986's Dario Argento's Demons movies might even recognize a little homage here. Anyhow, you get your money's worth here but for originality I recommend Nefarious instead.

tt13345606;Evil Dead Rise;jtindahouse;"The older I get, the harder I find it to buy into these supernatural style horror films. I just don't believe it basically, and so I sit there and don't feel any kind of fear or tension whatsoever throughout the movie. Robert Ebert once said however, it's not what the film is about, it's how it is about it. And looking at the film through that lens, it was pretty darn good.
I say that I don't find these types of movies scary, but I can confirm the woman sitting beside me in the theatre certainly did. She was sitting right forward in her chair, audibly gasping throughout the movie, covering her eyes and even gently rocking herself at one point. It's a small sample size, but if she represented the general public then I would say this movie has the ability to deliver some tension.
I thought the setting for the movie was well done. It's pretty hard to pull off an inner-city apartment building and make it feel isolated and like help is a long way away, but the film achieved just that. These people really do feel stuck where they are and escape is not an option.
There's a trope creeping into horror movies more and more which is to make one of the lead characters a pregnant lady. The theory of course being that a pregnant lady is going to have the audience extremely worried about her fate. Ironically, I think it drags a lot of the tension out of the movie. There isn't a major studio in existence that would let something truly bad happen to a pregnant woman. I'm always very disappointed when I see a horror movie introduce a character this way.
There's certainly plenty of gore. Apparently 6,500 litres of blood were used to make the film and when you see it you won't be left wondering where it all went. For what this was I have to say I had a pretty good time with it. 8/10.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3793011/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9004166/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-04-19

tt13345606;Evil Dead Rise;tresm87;"Evil dead 2013 absolutely shocked me to the core when I saw it opening day in theaters. I wasn't a huge fan of the original 2, but that one struck me to where I watched it multiple times in the theater. Needless to say I was very intrigued at what this decade later film could offer. Luckily I was able to attend an advanced screening in my city.
The gruesome brutality is clearly what people flock to see in this franchise. Maybe somewhat of the wacky dark comedy a bit as well. This film takes a classic franchise and tries to brand it to the younger generation and it can be to a fault somewhat . At times it meanders within the rather plain story that we've seen in other possession films. All the while still providing shocking and disgusting sequences.
A great blend of CGI and practical effects still being utilized really holds the film up imo. The SFX work is also top notch . Unfortunately I cannot say that I enjoyed the cast and the way their characters are written. Sometimes it felt like more of a Netflix horror film based on the mediocre acting as well as the cliche writing. There are some moments that I cannot believe we're even put in an evil dead film . This is where a few times I was displeased. I get trying to relate to a newer generation but it was overkill.
Overall this film brings the blood and the scares and at the end of the day that's what people are there to see. I just can't help but think it's a dramatic downturn in quality from the 2013 film.

tt13345606;Evil Dead Rise;prolelol;"Wow, what an insane movie! In fact, I think it was a little better than Evil Dead (2013).
First of all, I thought the story idea was excellently written. Once it makes you realize what kind of situation it is, it adds a lot more fun than you'd think. The plot worked much better and was more fun than Evil Dead (2013).
The opening scene was decent, with possibly one of the greatest movie title cards in modern horror days. It started well, but later it just got more and more insane. The cast of not-so-well-known actors was really great, with performances that felt like real people who became possessed. Alyssa Sutherland, who played the lead role, absolutely killed it; she was terrifying. I also really liked the night and rainy vibe, which added to the atmosphere. The kills were very fun and gory, exactly what I expected from a movie like this. The special effects were incredible. Although nothing beats the ending of Evil Dead (2013), I thought the ending was decent and cleared up all loose ends. It also added some comedy elements that reminded me of Evil Dead II.
Overall, I was honestly entertained by this movie, which made me feel tense and impressed. I thought it was a very well-done horror movie.
How would I compare this movie to Evil Dead (2013)? I think Evil Dead (2013) was more brutal and gory, with lots of blood, while Evil Dead Rise was more insane and creepy, with a better plot.
For those who have never watched any movies in the franchise, note that you absolutely don't need to watch any of the other movies to understand and enjoy this one.

They broke several canon rules: the Necronomicon had a name change, Bruce Campbell does not even appear in a cameo (but he does produce the film), the characters are unsympathetic and their lives are despicable, and the plot twists comply with all the techniques cheap that horror movies have accustomed us to today.

tt13345606;Evil Dead Rise;darkreignn;"To be honest, I'm not a big fan of the ""Evil Dead"" franchise. The original is a classic, and the 2013 remake is decent, but I've never really connected with the other installments. That's not to say they're not entertaining; it's just that they never truly resonated with me. However, despite my indifference toward the franchise, I decided to give the latest installment, ""Evil Dead Rise,"" a chance. And truth be told, I found myself practically shaking in excitement as I sat down in the theatre - all I wanted was what the trailer seemed to promise: Lots of blood, lots of gore, and lots of action. And after an entertaining start, with an opening that had my jaw on the floor and is worth the price of admission alone, setting the stage for a thrilling and suspenseful ride, it is my absolute displeasure to report that this movie disappointed me.
""Evil Dead Rise's"" decision to skip the streaming release and opt for a theatrical run seems justified given the film's impressive visuals and unsettling portrayal of the Deadites. After all, according to IMDb, ""['Evil Dead Rise'] was originally meant to release exclusively through HBOMax via direct-to-streaming, but it performed so strongly during test screenings that the studio decided to release it theatrically instead."" Would you believe me if I told you that it is evident that the film was originally going to be direct-to-streaming? Despite its strengths, the movie falls short of expectations for its lack of visceral gore, action, and scares. Now, this isn't to say that the quality isn't there - the movie looks absolutely amazing, with claustrophobic cinematography that echoes ""Rosemary's Baby"". Additionally, the Deadites looked legitimately evil, managing to have little old me commit to attending a church service on Sunday due to how sheerly satanic they looked. However, this movie's shortcomings leave viewers feeling unfulfilled, especially those who were hoping for a film that captures the blood-soaked madness of previous iterations.
Despite what the trailer suggests, the movie ultimately fails to deliver on its promise of extreme gore and blood-curdling violence. While it does contain some moments of bloodshed, they pale in comparison to the 2013 reboot, which featured much more graphic and disturbing elements, with everything from people slicing their cheek open to severing their own arm off with an electric meat cleaver. So, while the reboot from 2013 met my expectations in this regard, the latest installment seemed to pull its punches, leaving me wanting more. The violence felt sanitized and unimaginative, failing to evoke the sense of shock and disgust that I was hoping for. The film also lacked a sense of urgency and tension, leaving me bored and impatient throughout. The film almost feels like it is afraid to shock its audience - people get stabbed, tattooed, and stabbed again, and none of it is particularly exciting or different than anything you have seen before.
""Evil Dead Rise"" falls short on both the violence and the tension. The slow pacing and lackluster action scenes leave viewers feeling bored and unsatisfied. The lack of a satisfying payoff, combined with the toned-down approach to violence and gore make the movie a disappointment. On top of that, the film's runtime feels overly long, exacerbated by the lack of intensity in the scenes, resulting in an overall lackluster experience. While some may enjoy the movie (a 12 year old boy enthusiastically screamed, ""Hell yeah!"" upon the roll of the credits, so take that how you will) most viewers will likely walk out feeling disappointed and unsatisfied, having witnessed nothing new or exciting.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33659536/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9010839/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-04-22
tt13345606;Evil Dead Rise;moviemanmo;"Having enjoyed the last ""Evil Dead"" movie I was looking forward to seeing this. I didn't hate it, I just thought it was okay.
The girl who is possessed in the opening scene of the movie did well for the short time she was on screen. She should have been given a larger role.
Taking the story out of the woods and into an apartment building was a good creative decision. I would say it could have worked better if they took advantage of the fact that they were in a building. Perhaps have someone fall out of the building or have some chase scene in the hallways or through the apartments. It felt like they were pretty much in a cabin for most of the film since there weren't any lights and they were in the apartment for the most part.
I enjoyed Alyssa Sutherland's performance as the possessed mother. Her creepy look was the best part of this movie. The actors who played the children should have been more terrified considering what was going on, especially the youngest child. I felt the same about the actress who played Sutherland's sister. The adult neighbors were okay. The other children in the building didn't need to be in the movie.
Some of the decisions made by the characters are just ridiculous, I can't say too much on that without having spoilers. I didn't mind the over simplification of the plot, people watch these movies for the carnage. This movie delivers the carnage and gore. However, there are small things mentioned in this movie that could have used some explanation. For instance, explaining how the ""Book of the Dead"" made its way to this new location. I did like the addition of the audio record that accompanied the book in order to unleash the evil.
Some of the comedic elements in this movie were misplaced and took away from some of the scenes that were filled with tension. Some of the dialogue in this movie could have used some editing as well.
The character design at the end of the film did not work for me. It was a good idea that could have been executed better. The beginning of the film outweighs the ending.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur161226852/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9007684/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-04-21
tt13345606;Evil Dead Rise;scootm16;"It pains me terribly to say that this movie was not good. Over the years, 'The Evil Dead (1981)' has become one of my favorite movies of all time. I've watched the director commentary multiple times to see how they created a shoe-string budget indie masterpiece, which they explain through hilarious stories from the production/filming process. The entire cast/crew put themselves through the highest of highs and the lowest of lows to get the original 'Evil Dead' made. Nothing but sheer will-power and creative ingenuity are what got the original movie made. Actual blood, sweat and tears from the cast and crew poured onto the original, glorious-looking Necronomicon. None of that love went into this movie.
We've seen what a modern 'Evil Dead' can look like with 2013's remake, which I thought was pretty good, definitely miles better than this. This movie was extremely tame, way too tame to have 'Evil Dead' in the title. The cheese grater scene that was hyped up so much (that I was looking most forward to), that they made a WHOLE POSTER FOR, turned out to be a MASSIVE let down. The tattoo gun scene you get a glimpse of in the trailer? Also a massive let down. Why were they so afraid to show gore and intense violence in this one? 2013 (and the originals) went WAY harder than this. For God sake, a woman gets assaulted by a tree within the first 20 minutes of the original! No boundaries are pushed with this entry. It makes no sense why they went so tame for this, especially since Terrifier 2 (which just released last year and made BANK at the boxoffice) was extremely BRUTAL and had insanely gory and violent scenes that showed off somewhat cheesey, but also very impactful practical effects (what 'Evil Dead' is supposed to be all about).
There was a decade between this and the 2013 remake, and tons of production time, so why was the script so bad? The way the Necronomicon was discovered in this movie was some of the most lazy, terrible writing I have seen in years. Also, what is up with the characters? None of them are likable and they're all female, half of which are pronoun warriors. If I didnt know any better, I would've thought Disney had their hand in the writing material for this entry. The 'Evil Dead' franchise broke the mold by being one of the very few horror franchises to have a male be the hero/survivor. 99% of horror movies (especially today) have a final girl. We had Jane Levy as Mia in the 2013 remake swap roles with Ash by being the sole survivor of the Deadites, and I thought that worked pretty well. Levy kicked ass and earned her right to be the final girl. That is not the case in this movie.
Another thing I don't understand is if they're going to do something different with the franchise, why not go all the way? What I mean is that they changed the setting, and that's about it. The Necronomicon was discovered in the same way (albeit WAY dumber and less believable in this entry), the story beats were nothing new, a close knit group has to defend themselves from the Deadites, etc etc. Almost nothing but the setting (which they didn't even use well) was anything new for the franchise, so I'm not sure why they're trying to pass it off as some game-changing entry. They also used one floor of the apartment for 90% of the movie, so it's not like they even changed the setting that much.
The homages in this movie felt so out of place, like they were forced into the movie. 'Evil Dead Rise's' eyeball homage made me roll my eyes to the back of my skull, hoping I'd become possessed myself because it felt so forced. I could feel the director writing all these homages with a big grin on his face like 'Oh yeah, Mr. Raimi's gonna love this hehehe!'. At least 2013 was subtle with their homages, whereas this movie was just blatant and forced, making the homages feel extremely out of place. I'd rather they just did their own thing and not have any homages at all than get the homages I got.
THE GOOD PARTS: The main possessed mom actress stole the show. When she first got possessed, her movements and facial expressions were top notch. I'd say she's the best Deadite probably since first two 'Evil Dead' movies. I would even go to say she may be the best demonic portrayal in many years. She was really chewing up the scenery early on. Everyone else was just meh, but it's not the actors' fault that their characters are trashcans.
Obviously, there was gore, but really not that much, and when there was gore, a lot of the times it was implied. They'd pan away a lot when a kill or something gruesome was about to happen, or the character would kick the demon off before getting brutalized. This is easily the most tame 'Evil Dead' entry; some guys in the bathroom were even saying the same thing. The demon kill count is also pathetic; none of these women could kill a demon for the life of them. The theater I was in was damn near sold out, yet my girlfriend and I were the only ones to laugh during the entire showing. Everyone else was dead silent throughout the whole movie, so that should let you know how things were going.
OVERALL, this was a massive disappointment, but not just as an 'Evil Dead' movie, but as a horror movie. The movie doesn't stand on it's own enough; story and lore-wise, it just doesn't really carry the franchise forward in any meaningful way, leaving me questioning what the point of the movie is. At this point, I think it would be best for the 'Evil Dead' franchise to do what 2018's 'Halloween' did and only count the original 'Evil Dead' as existing, then make a trilogy from there. That being said, do it better than the new 'Halloween' trilogy because those took a nosedive quick. I'm not saying 'Don't see this movie'. By all means, see it. But don't expect to be on the edge of your seat terrified. Don't expect creative and crazy camera work, lighting or practical effects. Don't expect the franchise's story to move forward in any meaningful way. But most saddening, don't expect any soul in this movie (possibly because it was sucked dry by the studio). Hopefully, for the next entry, they get Damien Leone or Ari Aster, someone who is passionate and thrives in the indie horror scene and pushes boundaries when it comes to extreme horror; something 'Evil Dead' is supposed to be about, but apparently not this time.
EDIT (May 5): Upon a second viewing, I've gotta admit... that this movie is indeed bad. I double down on everything I said previously. They did to Evil Dead what Disney did to Star Wars. How they found the book is awful, the deaths (which are almost all off screen) were lame and uninspired, the setting was completely wasted, and all the characters were worthless and annoying. This movie felt like a dumb kid (Lee Cronin) copying an essay of a smart kid (Sam Raimi) and just changing one word per paragraph to try and pass it off as their own. What a joke.

tt13345606;Evil Dead Rise;saint_brett;"What have we got here? Another female empowerment movie that fits today's trend and caters to people like Jamie Lee Curtis and Kathleen Kennedy while excluding us fans who made these movies what they became. (We're kind of like sacrificial lambs in the eyes of Hollywood today, to the detriment of their box office sales.) Evil Dead sure has come a long way since, at first, only Renaissance Pictures and Rosebud came knocking to distribute it.
Where were Warner Brothers and New Line Cinema in 1981? Not too many big production companies wanted anything to do with that movie, just like the original Texas Chainsaw. The bigger companies get their hands on it years later, and the movies decline. ""Evil Dead Rise"" is no exception. It's as bad as the ""Evil Dead"" 2013 remake, with little to no substance.
So, we've left the woods of Wadesboro and Morristown for New Zealand, eh? How'd the Evil Dead migrate all the way down there? It's as mysterious as how Colonel Cochran got the piece of Stonehenge to sleepy Santa Mira without explanation.
The movie starts out with Rose Byrne sunbathing on the Oreti River, and what's this? A 2016 ""Blair Witch"" drone that's being controlled by an intoxicated Lautner character from ""Twilight."" Wow, the first words spoken in this movie involve the F word.
That's some Rob Zombie ""Halloween"" stuff.
This reading of Wuthering Heights is paying homage to Cheryl reading the playing cards in the original, right?
The prosthetic head at the 6 minute mark is prop stuff one would use on YouTube.
Where'd they steal this Disposable Teens Marilyn Manson part at the 6 minute, 14 second mark with Warner coming out of the water?
There's a bit of ""Piranha"" business going on as well.
Why didn't they just crap-can this project and make an ""Ash vs. Evil Dead"" movie instead? At least that TV series felt like Evil Dead to some extent. This movie has no atmosphere or feel to it.
How could they cast Justin Bieber as a DJ in this?
What has he done to qualify for an Evil Dead movie when he only made a special cameo on a CSI TV show? Remember him being arrested at the end of that and the cop saying, ""Watch your hair getting in."" He was brooding in the back of that cop vehicle like the hard homie he is. All the new kids on the block and backstreet twits found their new antihero.
Yes, there are crappy Freddy movies! Try The Dream Child on for size. Or that atrocious 1994 New Migraine garbage.
Freddy vs. Jason didn't fare much better either. ""Freddy's got this teensy-weensy little thing, and Jason's got this big old one.""
Hmm, what am I watching here? An episode of ""Bold and the Beautiful."" An earthquake causes three good pizzas to go to waste as the aftereffects of the dropped pizza cause a ripple in the asphalt, and Bieber finds a warp zone to the bank of New Zealand, where he withdraws a couple of LPs and a library book that has teeth.
I'm picking up ""American Horror Story"" vibes about this with a touch of that nun character from ""The Conjuring.""
54 minutes in, and this is boring. It's too dark. Not only is it too dark, but they have a blackout on top of that, making it darker.
It's un-Evil Dead. It feels too much like some Asian horror movie, like I thought it would be.
The movie's fragmented and seems to keep refreshing on a new plateau with each new character slowly being presented, like they're revealing a big boss in a video game that's going to shock the audience with each new reveal. Every scene is like the beginning of the movie with these long-winded, drawn-out introduction build-ups, and they do this till the very end, which is really annoying. The movie's not flowing naturally. They're playing it safe because the actors are all amateurs.
The Bridget character with the short, cropped hair wouldn't be the same actress from that horrible biscuit episode of The Mandalorian, would she? Her character is taking me back to season 3, episode 2, which makes me want to swallow my own vomit.
The apartment building setting doesn't do it for me.
Evil Dead only works in castles or the woods. (I think that castle from ""Evil Dead 2"" should have been explored more. Not in that ""Army of Darkness"" manner, though.)
This dead by dawn homage is cheap and not doing it for me either.
""The Shining"" has already done this lift scene.
Wow, Newt just got taken by the aliens again.
Nope, nope, nope!
""Evil Dead Rise"" is all wrong.
Movies continue to fail.
No wonder everyone has turned to TV series lately.
The cinema ain't working anymore.
Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell actually funded someone else to write and direct this? And they approved the final outcome?
This isn't Evil Dead.
If this is the future, then count me out.
I doubt I could watch this on repeat.
I watched that horrible 2013 remake only twice and never again.
Perhaps you guys should close the curtain on this whole Necronomicon franchise, as it's becoming embarrassing now.
I don't know anymore when it comes to entertainment.
It's just not working anymore.
Everything is stale and played out.
The stories are tired.
What was that end boss pieced together all about? It wasn't even memorable. If you want something scary, check out the end boss from the video game Super Metroid.
And why was there a woodchipper in an underground carpark, or how'd it fit under there when the entrance barely fit a small car?
You know what would be a good idea for an Evil Dead movie? Put a well-known cast together and throw some curveballs with actors like Sandra Bullock, Steve Martin, The Rock, and Hellen Mirren, and totally turn it on its head and kill them all off in brutal ways.
Quick, somebody grab a hospital grade strength air freshener; ""Evil Dead Rise"" just stunk the cinema up! I want a full refund. Horror movies aren't even scary anymore. The Evil Dead just died. Let it rest.
I'll rate ""Evil Dead Rise"" 3/10.
One point for the eeny, meeny, miny, moe part.
And two points for the first nursery rhyme song that reminded me of a Korn song.
And a third point for the, um, I don't know?
I can't think of any other memorable part.
So, 2/10 it is.
But even then, it's sailing close to a 1/10 for how putrid it is.";2;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur88913493/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9049689/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-12
tt13345606;Evil Dead Rise;kevin_robbins;"The Evil Dead Rise (2023) is a movie that I caught in theatres tonight. The storyline follows a family who lives in a California apartment building. An Earthquake hits and a section of the building with a tomb inside is discovered by the children of the family. They find a book in the tomb that unleashes hell.
This movie is written and directed by Lee Cronin (The Hole in the Ground) and stars Alyssa Sutherland (Vikings), Mirabai Pease (The Gulf), Lily Sullivan (Mental), Gabrielle Echols (Reminiscence) and Nell Fisher (Northspur).
This has everything a horror enthusiast would want. The storyline and dialogue is well written with characters that are interesting and the family dynamic is well established. The acting is excellent with perfect mannerisms and body language. The horror elements are a 100/10. The opening dock scene, the bath tub sequence, the kitchen battle and every scene in a hallway was magnificent. The blood splatter was elite. I also loved how they paid homage to The Shining and The Thing. The cinematography and camera angles are in classic Evil Dead fashion and I enjoyed the background music, sound effects and soundtrack also.
Overall, this was a tremendous addition to the Evil Dead franchise. I would score this an 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it.";9;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur131783850/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9007559/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-04-21

The charm of these movies was the low budget and almost home recording like feeling, as well as the dark comedy that was always present behind the creepy atmosphere. That said, I had super low expectations on this ""sequel"" - and yet I was shocked when it was finished. Shocked as in ""this could quite possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen in a theatre - or anywhere"". It feels like a big budget movie made for the restless and self absorbed selfie generation. A long carneval of ""scare"" scenes drenched in cgi, adding nothing new to the table of cheap scare horror films. Don't get me started on the acting and the dialogue. Dear oh dear.

tt10954600;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania;cardsrock;"After most entries in Phase 4 passed by without doing much to set up the next big bad in the MCU, I was eagerly anticipating this film given it would be the big screen introduction of Kang. While Majors shines as Kang, the rest of the film and even some of the narrative choices with Kang leave a bit of a ""meh"" feeling.
As far as positives, Paul Rudd remains as endearing as ever. MODOK is a tad jarring, but I liked the tie-in to Yellowjacket. The visuals are solid and it's a very colorful movie. Majors truly has a magnetic presence on screen and I found his dialogues and conversations to be very compelling.
For negatives, there aren't really any arcs for the characters and Ant-Man himself ends up in literally the same place (on the sidewalk thinking about how good his life is) as the beginning of the film. Scott's cohorts aren't given much to do either. The MCU hallmark of jokes undercutting serious moments unfortunately continues and honestly the comedy really didn't land as well as the first two films. I also got major Rise of Skywalker vibes with the cliche ""everyone in the rebellion shows up to fight the space troopers at the end.""
However, my big issue with the film is the ending. This movie felt like it should've had some major consequences to establish Kang as an Avengers-level threat. Having Scott and Hope dispatch him while a portal opens up to save them literally seconds after you thought they might get trapped in the Quantum Realm or Kang would escape was eyeroll-inducing. The Council of Kangs scene was also almost more goofy than menacing.
I'm hopeful that Feige can right the ship and get the Multiverse Saga to Infinity Saga levels of hype, but right now I'm just left not feeling much. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm currently looking forward more to seeing how The Flash movie resets the DCU than how the MCU multiverse plays out.";6;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24373984/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8875577/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-02-17
tt10954600;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania;flicklover;"Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging us just flat here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being just painfully average. It's never boring but it's just not exciting or engaging.
Just average in an MCU that us just churning out film after film with average results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films better when the MCU started.
Painfully average.

What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense.

The CGI was very rough in places, and the editing was very off at times. It could have used an extra few months in development. At that, Modok was atrocious in execution.

tt10954600;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania;FeastMode;"I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.
My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.
The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.
There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart (and crazy) like me and don't watch trailers. But he's so damn awesome.
As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not joining the MCU doom and gloom crowd. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4).

The created living entities of the quantum universe are more anthropomorphic (human-based) perhaps to be more relatable to children does not reflect the diversity or original forms of life or new-life that would really make this film stellar. As even as special as the set designs and special effects make for a gorgeous setting, there is still room for more crisp, detailed and immersive design work. Some backgrounds end up being mere basic animation projections that do not come up to the level expected of contemporary Marvel productions.

Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.
I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.
It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.
Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.
It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.
I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.
And 6, and 7.
This will go on forever...

tt10954600;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania;MrDHWong;"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the first film of Phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, it ranks among the MCU's weakest efforts in its execution of both fun and emotional payoffs.
Some time after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoying being in the spotlight with the recent publication of his autobiography. While Scott is hanging out with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), and Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), the group are accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm, where they each discover it is not as destitute as they had initially thought. Soon, the group learn of a dangerous new threat inhabiting the Realm known as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who will stop at nothing to escape his fate as a prisoner of this place. As Kang makes his position clear, it is up to Scott and the others to stop Kang before irreversible damage is inflicted on all of space and time.
Right now, it seems the MCU is in a strange holding pattern after ""Avengers: Endgame"". Although there have been several films and TV shows made since then, there hasn't really been any concrete indication of what to expect from where the series is heading. This is because even after all these years, we haven't had any proper build-up to whom the main villain will be that is taking over from Thanos. While ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" at least establishes some things to look forward to in the future, it never does so in a way that can distinguish itself as nothing more than a relatively mediocre entry in this already expansive cinematic universe.
Given that this film is supposed to kick off Phase 5, it surprises me how few exciting moments there were to hype up the audience. The previous two ""Ant-Man"" films contain some of the funniest, most entertaining scenes that fans like myself have come to appreciate from the MCU after all these years. Yet here, I struggled to find anything remotely enjoyable that could leave an impression on the viewer. Aside from the odd dry banter from Scott, there are no amusing scenes of comic relief to alleviate the severity of whenever something bad has taken place. Most other MCU films have been able to strike a balance between humorous and dramatic but this one leans so heavily on its dark tone that it is simply not fun to watch at times. If the filmmakers wanted make a darker ""Ant-Man"" film, that's fine, but this is not the way they should have gone about it.
Another big problem is that the film goes way too far with its overuse of CGI. Though the MCU has used plenty of CGI in prior films, they at least tried to make it look like it had some basis in reality to give the audience the impression that what was on screen could be imagined as physically right in front of the characters. Here, it is used so much as a means to an end that the whole film looks about as realistic as the Star Wars prequels. At no point did the Quantum Realm ever feel like a real place inhabited by its population of various creatures. Instead, we constantly have to watch the actors move around within the limited confines of what I assume is where green screen stages were in ways that looked so planned out that it doesn't match the vibrant environments they are projected against. Everything looks so clean and sterile that it is near impossible to imagine the characters actually being there in any of these locations. At first, I thought maybe I have just become desensitised to CGI in general but as the visual effects kept piling up here, I found myself becoming less and less invested in the story, which has never happened to me with other MCU entries until now.
The cast of the film were fine, considering what they had to work with, but I doubt this will be viewed as them at their best. Paul Rudd still exudes his likeable charm as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who is now treated like a true hero by the general public. I'll admit it's nice to see an underdog like Scott finally get the recognition he deserves after all this time, especially considering the important part he played in helping the Avengers bring back half of the universe's population from Thanos's actions. Scott's best scenes were with his daughter Cassie, with Kathryn Newton now playing the role in place of Emma Fuhrmann. At first, I wasn't sure about the recasting of the character, but Newton proved she was right for the part. Some of the physical requirements for the character seemed to come naturally for Newton and she also had pretty good chemistry with Rudd as her onscreen father.
I was somewhat underwhelmed by how Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas were used this time around. For a film that has ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" in its title, we don't really see enough of the titular characters doing things together. Instead, Hope mainly hangs around with her parents, and while this does provide some decent scenes of the three bonding together, it still seems like a strange creative decision to keep her separate from Scott for so long. Additionally, Douglas and Pfeiffer, while not exactly going to waste, didn't contribute as much to story as I had hoped. If it weren't for one crucial scene near the end, I'd say that Hank and Janet's presence in the film was quite forgettable. Most of the time I kept forgetting about them as I cared more about what was happening with Scott and Cassie in the meantime.
However, the one character that stood out the most to me was Kang the Conqueror, played by a surprisingly intimidating Jonathan Majors. Anybody who watched the first season of the Disney+ series ""Loki"" will remember this character, who was known back then as ""He Who Remains"". This time, we get a better look at Kang's motivations as a villain and why he is so determined to inflict chaos on all the different multiverses. Majors does a good job at concealing Kang's true personality, whose vulnerability is used as a facade for his malicious intent. I guess I liked watching Kang the most because he is the only character in the film with some kind of interesting end goal, while all the others are only there to try and stop him. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang in future MCU projects, as I think he has the potential to be as threatening as Thanos was back in the Infinity Saga.
For the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" just doesn't land in the same way as the previous films. It tries hard to be one of the darker entries in the series by upping the ante with its main villain but it ends up relying too much on the audience's assumption that things will be addressed in more detail later on. At this point, I can only hope that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", the next film in the MCU release schedule, will leave a better impression on me and other long time fans because if that doesn't work, we're in for a relatively dull Phase 5.
I rate it 6/10.";6;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8873784/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-02-16
tt10954600;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania;MamadNobari97;"Where do I even begin? They somehow made a movie that's even worse and more uninteresting than the second Ant-Man movie. I haven't been this uninvested in an MCU movie since Thor 4 and Captain Marvel. Like another reviewer said, who even cares anymore?
First of all, the first act of this movie is probably the worst first act of any MCU movie I've seen in a while. It's also artificially made boring and uninteresting because they do this stupidest trope of one character hiding something from the others and not telling them until the middle of the movie and their explanation for it is ""I wanted to protect you"". Protect her from what? An angry guy with the size of an atom in the Quantum Realm? Not telling your family of ""scientists"" about the actual dangers of Quantum Realm and then getting mad when they eff with it is protecting them? I hate this trope so much because there's no point to it. The only reason they did that was to postpone introducing Kang and showing his flashbacks till the second act.
The first act is completely boring but it gets just a little better and more interesting when they introduce Kang. But the movie gets boring and uninteresting as it goes anyway.
There is no character arc in this movie. Marvel, or rather the writers they hire have forgotten how to write scripts anymore. They don't even care enough to have character arcs, so it's no surprise they don't do any characterization for the new characters either.
Remember the first Doctor Strange movie? Remember his memorable character arc throughout his first movie? Remember when MCU writers had an iota of an idea of how to write a movie and make the audience actually care about the characters and have interesting characters? Remember when they actually tried? Now compare that to the second Doctor Strange movie where he doesn't even feel like the main character of his own movie, now imagine something that's somehow even worse and you get this movie.
I don't even know who's the main character of this movie. Scott Lang doesn't have a character arc in this movie. Her daughter wants to help the resistance people for some reason and Lang who is the ""hero"" apparently, doesn't care and doesn't even change at the end. Things just happen and they go through it and that's that, no character growth and no nothing.
They for some reason again mislead us in the trailers that Scott wants to help Kang because he missed Cassie's childhood. But this is nowhere to be found in the actual movie. Now I know about Marvel trailers and that they have misleading footage and stuff that aren't in the movie, but they aren't usually as misleading as this one. And the funny thing is, this could've worked better than whatever cliché we got in the actual film.
Also, what's with the kid genius trope we keep seeing in these movies? Why does every child of these superheroes have to be a genius scientist and inventor all of a sudden? Can't they be a normal child with normal lives for once? All of them have to invent some multiverse-bending device in their garage that even Tony Stark couldn't've made?
And speaking of the resistance people, please show me someone who actually watched this movie and cared about them or even remembers their names. The writers don't even do the bare minimum of characterizing them. You won't care about these people or their uprising and revolution when watching this movie. You won't care about any of them dying.
This movie was only made to introduce Kang and nothing else. The writers don't care about characterization or character arcs or even writing a decent plot with what they've got. Why even make this movie when we had Kang introduced in Loki? This adds nothing and is repetitive. You don't even need to see this movie if you have seen Loki. Somehow Loki gave more backstory and characterization to this next big baddie of the MCU than this movie, and he was only in the last episode of that show, so you go figure!
It's obvious that they saw the backlash and mediocre reactions to Phase 4 and decided to make Kang the villain of this movie and start Phase 5 with this to set him up as the next big villain and hype people up again, and they failed miserably at that.
MODOK's design and CGI are somehow even worse than the floating head in Thor 4. It's probably the goofiest and worst thing I've seen in a while, and his character doesn't even have a place in this movie. The design of his armor when he's not showing his face is alright, but my god what an atrocious monstrosity! I don't even know what they were thinking designing him like that. Even Marvel's Avengers game had a better design than this, and that game had the blandest and forgettable face designs ever. And the only reason he was in this movie was to have something connected to the first Ant-Man movie. He doesn't serve a purpose in this movie and they even dare thinking we would care about him.
Speaking of the first Ant-Man movie, that movie at least knew how to be a little fun movie about Scott Lang and a reasonable throwaway villain, not a giant world-ending event with a big baddie that's out of Ant-Man's league. If you've seen The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, you know that all the Avengers combined can't even defeat Kang, but here we are with Ant-Man and the Wasp and his daughter saving the world from this omnipotent god. And this omnipotent god has robot soldiers that somehow die from a paintball bullet. This is why it's tricky to have a villain that's omnipotent, because you make it harder for the audience to believe that he would be this dumb to have prison cells that can be opened if you stick a fork into their control panels and robots that die from a punch and him getting defeated at the end somehow.
And this is one of the biggest reasons Phase 4, and apparently Phase 5 now have been a huge disappointment for me, especially for the Dinsey Plus shows; the fact that each and every one of them has to end with a huge gigantic clusterfk of an ending and third act, with two Kaijus punching each other. Shang-Chi that's about this father and son? End it with a big fight in the third act with a giant Dragon. Moon Knight which is a street-level superhero? End it with two Kaijus punching each other. Black Widow? Some CGI vomit of bad action in the sky or something. Eternals? Same Kaiju fighting. Same with What If and Ms. Marvel. Just have a big battle or even a full-on war like Wakanda Forever in your third act. Just have ""world-ending"" ""stakes"" in each and every project of yours, doesn't matter how big or small the superhero is. I think pretty much most of the audience apart from the Marvel fanboys have gotten tired of this formula since a long time ago, I don't understand how the producers and writers haven't yet.
This movie is also CGI galore and I don't think there was even one real set. The actors probably still never met each other and all of them were shot separately.
I also remember when they said Ant-Man couldn't take his mask off if he's small or big, but here we are having him enlarged to the size of Kong and having his helmet off easily like it's nothing. There's no difference in pressure on his body and his head when he's large and takes his helmet off. So what's even the point of having a helmet in the first place? Just stab yourself with one of those blue enlargement pills ;) and get big or small.
I have rambled a lot, but the more I write, the more I realize I don't care about this movie and it's probably better to stop wasting more time on it and move on.
All in all, this movie is a big disappointment and fails at pretty much everything it does or tries to do. There is no characterization or character arc, there is no real tension and you won't care about anything and anybody because they don't take time to develop characters, the movie is full of tropes and clichés and all in a bad way, Kang has a better introduction in Loki, the movie is all CGI and action and is somehow on par with Eternals on how boring and uninteresting it is.
The M(id)CU continues to be mid and they are progressively getting worse with writing actual decent plots, characters, and villains, and I don't think most people care anymore about what the next MCU movie is gonna be about (apart from GOTG3) and which version of Kang we're gonna see next. The hype and excitement and investment people had MCU has significantly died down since Endgame and I don't think most people now care about what's coming in the future.
I don't even have a morsel of hope in what they're gonna do with the X-Men, Blade, Daredevil, and Fantastic Four. If they can't even think of a good story to tell for Ant-Man and Wasp and they just throw the next big baddie in there to fight, they probably will have ran out of ideas by the time they're gonna make X-Men.";4;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45507551/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8875000/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-02-16
tt10954600;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania;rgkarim;"LIKES:
The Graphics/World Design -Marvel really has a great budget to create worlds from our imagination and this installment continues to make it happen.
-Lavish colors, odd beasts, a world that Strange World was trying to make but with more thought and layering.
-Great cultures, a comic book sense of atmosphere, and a new world to which lots of foundations may just build from in the future.
-Feels like a strong mash up of Star Wars, Marvel, and Battlestar with pinches of other movies to help spice up a few things with them as well. Nice references indeed.
The Comedy At Times -The comedy is awesome often thanks to writing and Paul Rudd making the lines come to life.
-The snarky humor and sarcasm works very well, and I truly did laugh a bunch at how he just owns AntMan and makes it work on levels to be fun.
-There are plenty of aggressive lines that will be there for people to enjoy, several filled with cursing so caution, but it works when in balance and timed just right.
-And some running gags add a little spice to the mix as well, and that was awesome to say the least.
-Overall, the comedy works for me, but there are limitations to be mentioned at a later section.
The Action At Times -The action does have these moments that show Marvel can still make a good fight.
-Choreography has some flavor, the powers are fun, and the use of that awesome design comes out pretty well.
-Several moments have some impressive strategy behind it, and again surprises me with how some of these stunt people can move.
-And there is musical and visual support to help make everything come to life and have that movie magic that we love in these films.
-Throw in some emotional moments that work to add that bite and edge, and several comedic moments, and AntMan 3 really helps add a little more sauce to the factor that many come to these movies for.
The Character Development At Times -Kang is the lead for me on this film, in just how much they took the one moment we had with him before and amplifies it so well. He gets a lot of time to flourish and I totally agree that he is worth it.
-As for Scott, again he and Janet get some surprising levels that I love and these moments really help amplify those who seem somewhat forgettable, a joke of the movie, and really bring them to the forefront to be the heroes we want.
The Acting -Marvel is not often loaded with duds, so I can't say that I was surprised to see a strong hand played for this film.
-I'd say just about everyone hits their mark, but I have limited room, so I'll stick to the three top listed and go from there.
-Rudd is hilarious, hands down a solid balance of comedy, emotion, and bravado that establishes the themes of this movie and often does not stray into overacting. So natural in his delivery he keeps entertainment and drama in check.
-Lilly was fine in her time on the screen, but I can't say that Hope had the same punches or influence on me as the past. She seemed a little laid back, lackluster, and then finally picks it up but not to the degree I've seen her in other films.
-Majors though, wow, Majors kills this role. The man knows how to articulate movements, add elements to his speech and craft this role so well. Kang is such a layered villain and Majors destroys it with the way he incorporates so much into one man. What a fantastic ability to do so much.
DISLIKES:
The Pace Is A Fast -Normally this is a good thing, and by the end you'll see why it might be a bit bad.
-Quantumania really has a lot of things launching from it, and not everything was fleshed out, thought through, or detailed as Phase 1 and 2 were able to do for the most part.
-It was great to see so much, and yet, it moved a tad too fast for me to really get everything down and have that commitment.
-Perhaps they tried to launch too much and had they toned back, several parts of this could have had a consistently strong bite that these climactic moments had.
-Though my bladder was happy, I think this one needed to slow down a bit in my opinion.
The Character Development Is Bland At Times -With that pace, some development felt a bit simplified and lacking.
-Hope gets little for me in terms of truly worthwhile investment, and Hank is more comedic than truly amazing, lost to a secondary character status.
-Several other new members are there to have an inconsistent bite, and though there are shining moments, there are sadly not the same speed that I like in my character stories.
-Thus, these blander moments aren't the worst, but given the magic of Avengers and Civil War, I guess I expected more in this tale.
Many Elements Feel Simplified: -Again, there is a lot of potential in this movie, and yet... did it fully achieve it?
-Some levels, yes, there are these champion aspects I wish I got more time with and had smoother transitions.
-And yet other things just felt so watered down. Several cultural tribes and relationships. New characters who had abilities to dig out things, but were comedic only, and even several elements of exploration were lost.
-All this build up at times sometimes just flops out and again, we are left with a bare bone, C-grade means to tell the tale.
The Comedy Forced Sometimes -There is plenty of good laughs to be had and I admit again I chuckled a bunch, especially some of the adult jokes.
-But... again we have been robbed of balance and sometimes the comedy tried too hard to be funny for me and tripped up the momentum to be had.
-A running gag about how to punch sometimes flopped for me, other times it was just stopping to joke during an action scene, and other times was just a joke going too far for me that it lost its edge for me.
-I'm not saying it reached levels of Thor, but... I can also say sometimes the edge needed to win and stay while the jokes were left behind.
The Action Could Have Been More -Again, there are moments where the action is on fire and some of the best I've seen in a while.
-But that doesn't mean it approaches the level that other films have done and given the buildup, I guess I feel more of it than other films.
-Many action sequences last less than 5 minutes, with a tad simplification and a minimization to the chaos they could have had.
-A few bad guys to beat down or at least scare off? Maybe a run in with Kang earlier and fleeing from him to an extent far less trivial.
-And they still have not gotten big battles with lots of pieces the due time and natural development I know they can do.
-Thus, the action could have been more in my opinion.
The VERDICT The opening hand for Phase 5 is heavy and truly a visionary wonder to behold. AntMan's third trip to the screens is loaded with a bunch of things you might like in regards to your movie with action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in a lot of Marvel's productions. It really has a lot of good in my opinion and has done the job of set up and entertainment to the point that there is a lot to uncover. Some good character use, a dab of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters is a nice foundation, and the comedic antics with the comic capers of fighting further help add the spice to things that I like in a movie. Not to mention, Majors really is a welcome addition for me and what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. And yet, the movie still has balance issues, primarily in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not doing too much. I think there was a lot they try to accomplish, which they kind of did, but I just think more time or less content would have helped with character usage, action, and that full effect I like to see in other movies. Still, I don't think this is horrible, nor do I think it is perfect, but the opening gamble was enjoyable for me. My scores are:

The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design.

The first Ant-Man movie was a nice one, the second one was okay, but if you take away all the (finally by computer generated) visuals and effects, there is maybe enough story left in this third chapter to employ two or maybe three and a half brain cells of the viewer.

Sorry not sorry. I was actually excited for this movie, but once again this movie is just riddled with witty and snarky humor that it takes away from the precedence story.

A few simple conversations, a couple confessions, and most of the problems in this movie would have been resolved. However, I was happy to see that it isn't too tied into other MCU properties, and it does offer some resolution in the end.

tt10954600;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania;BirdzOfParadise;"Let's start with the con, the story. It could have and should have been so much more. They had a great idea, but the writers seemingly lacked the creativity and depth to really take this to its potential. I'm beginning to believe my comic book fan brother who for years has said the MCU is geared toward children as these last two phases for sure just don't seem to tackle their stories with any depth or coherency to them.
But the pros...Jonathan Majors not only landed this role but delivered more than I had expected. With different writing I feel even he could have been more but with what he had to work with, he gave us so much...definitely one of the best performances in the MCU. I like this Cassie better than the Endgame Cassie, Altho I hate how the latter learned she wouldn't be returning. And the ants are unsung heroes of this franchise once again.

tt10954600;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania;glennmeerten06;"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.
It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential.";7;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur54651770/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8873180/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-02-15
tt10954600;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania;Chance_Boudreaux19;"The MCU in its current state is an absolute mess. Up until Endgame the whole series of movies felt like it lead up to something and now it's all over the place. Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania was supposed to introduce the next big bad that the Avengers will face in the form of Kang The Conqueror and I guess it did. First of all, Jonathan Majors plays the role well but the character itself seems like a total wimp. This is supposed to be one of the most powerful Kang variants and yet he gets trapped (maybe killed?) by Ant-Man and the Wasp without any sacrifice. Now, if the movie had the audacity to sacrifice both titular characters in order for them to stop Kang from escaping the Quantumverse it would've worked better but as it stands the movie takes no risks and has the villain defeated by characters that aren't even that powerful. After all that how are we as the audience supposed to believe that this guy can be a threat to more powerful Avengers like Thor or Dr Strange. On the other hand, if the movie did sacrifice any of the major characters it still wouldn't change how I feel about it. In fact, it would've maybe been a waste to sacrifice Ant-Man in such a bland and uninteresting film.
The whole thing feels so dull and lifeless that I could not concentrate on what was going on. I was so bored I found myself switching off at various points throughout. Scorcese compared these movies to amusement parks but I wish it was that. I wish it produced moments that would have me entertained but instead it feels on the same level as Morbius. It's certainly more competent than that pile of garbage but I was equally bored whilst watching either of them. On top of that, the characters make nonsensical decisions that I'm supposed to buy without thinking too much about like Michelle Pfeiffer not telling anyone about Kang. Moreover, it's not funny and in general I'm tired of the quippy, inconsequential dross that Marvel is spewing out. Maybe, I'm not the audience for these movies anymore but I don't go into them wanting to dislike them. I want to feel the highs that the Infinity Saga provided again but I don't see it happening. With the exception of No Way Home none of the movies since Endgame have been great and at best they've been mildly entertaining. I also haven't watched any of the MCU shows yet and I'm not planning to because I don't want Marvel to be such a major part of my life, there's too much great cinema out there to devote this much time to something so mediocre. The highest praise I can give Ant-Man and the Wasp is that it's inoffensive and relatively short, although it felt long for me. Also, the performances from Majors, Paul Rudd and others are good. Apart from that, it's just a cookie-cutter husk of a film that looks incredibly artificial and is only designed to set up future events and to sell you on watching more of the current MCU's endless trash content.";4;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57999530/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8905852/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-03-04

The action and special effects still display the usual MCU level of polish but are not necessarily exciting.

tt10954600;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania;Avwillfan89;"This film is unspeakably bad.
It's actually worse than Eternals. Because I didn't care for any of those characters, it didn't bother me as much. Also Chloe Zhao, while being a great director, was simply badly chosen for that kind of film as sci-fi superhero entries are not her strong point.
In the case of this, there is absolutely NO excuse for how bad this is. I liked Scott Lang in other films, especially the ensemble ones like Endgame and Civil War. But seeing him in this travesty, where there is no strong development to any of its characters and has one of the weakest plots ever, is truly depressing.
Its entire purpose is only to introduce the next big bad guy of the multiverse saga: Kang the Conquerer.
Johnathan Majors is probably the best thing about the film, as he really exudes a brooding menace and aggressive physicality. But that's about it.
I ACTIVELY despised Cassie Lang in this film. Her character is so annoying, shallow and ridiculously badly written and acted. This is the third time in almost a year that there has been a young character with special abilities or technology whose sole purpose is to move the plot forward and be an inspiration to younger viewers. In the Multiverse of Madness, you had America Chavez, which was actually OK, but you could only kind of get away with it once. The second time with Riri Williams in Wakanda Forever, I was like: Really, again? And then with this, I went: Oh wait, this deliberate goal to create a Mary Sue teenager that promotes activism and surface level inspiration. And is just brilliant at everything she does and never has to learn anything because she is just awesome as she is. Ugh.
Also Darren, the villain from the first film, shows up as MODOK as second villain. But then after Cassie simply tells him to ""Stop being a dick."" he... is no longer a villain and now wants to be a hero? That was THE dumbest part of the movie for me. What the hell were they thinking?
It's not even worth watching the end-credits, as one has already wasted two hours watching this. I'm glad I didn't waste money in the cinema.

tt10954600;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania;r96sk;"A fun one!
I had a terrific time watching 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.
Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.
Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M. O. D. O. K. Is a lot of fun.
Looking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking.";9;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur49400835/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8930402/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-03-15

There's no exposition of where everything came from so it's just the quantum realm and you have to accept it. It's kind of true for a lot of films these days but it's just such a surprise which makes it noticeable.

So that's not a good start going into this movie, the MCU had a large hill to climb to get back on track and I hate to say it but they failed again, but where to go from this as I'm not going to spoil things as I don't really want to talk about the plot as it's not that interesting, a villain is introduced that I'm not invested in as he's not been built up, but dropped in front of us and we're told to love this - again, without development of pace...again.
I'm sort of ready to completely drop all Superhero movies from this point onwards as nothing is working, it's filled with irrelevance and can only get worse from here.

tt10954600;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania;vinniec-53536;In Marvel Studios' 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', our favorite pint-sized (and occasionally giant-sized) hero Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and co. Are sucked into, and subsequently trapped in, the otherworldly Quantum Realm. There, Scott is forced to make a deal with the Devil, or in this case the dictatorial Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), the only one with the means to get them home. As the title suggests, the majority of the movie takes place in this subatomic universe, which doesn't look half-bad, considering it's basically a fully-CG environment. It is home to some unique creatures and residents, who have fairly minimal roles and are ultimately kinda forgettable, though the one named Veb was hilarious. The movie wastes no time getting the plot in motion, as we're off into the Quantum Realm within the first 10 minutes, and it's pretty well-paced overall. As far as the cast, everyone does a solid job. Paul Rudd is delightful as usual, and Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet van Dyne gets some time to shine in a larger role than expected. Newcomer Kathryn Newton portrays Scott's now-teenaged daughter Cassie, and while it was cool seeing her suit-up alongside her dad, she comes off as a bit unbelievable at times. However, it's Jonathan Majors' Kang who steals the show. He's menacing, intimidating, and has a calm-yet-confident demeanor. I've always loved characters who know how much of a threat they are, like Darth Vader, and Kang definitely fits into that category. I truly cannot wait to see more of him in future MCU projects. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention MODOK, the most perfectly goofy and ridiculous character I've ever had the pleasure of meeting in a movie. Overall, 'Quantumania' is much bigger in scale than the previous films in the 'Ant-Man' series, but still retains most of the humor and heart that they've become known for. In fact, I personally like it better than the last installment, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp'. It's a fun, extremely comic book-y (in a good way) family adventure through an intriguing sci-fi world, and I definitely had a good time watching.;7;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur87833656/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8885390/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-02-22
tt10279472;The Black Demon;FeastMode;"That headline is not a reference from The Black Demon. It's a question I have for the movie. To say it's all over the place would be a severe understatement. It doesn't know what it wants to be. Most people will watch this because they want to see a creature feature, but that plays a tiny part in this movie. Even it's themes and messages are so random and unconnected.
The Black Demon opens with a scene that made me think, ""Oh no, what have I gotten myself into."" It seemed immediately bad even by B-movie standards. Then it does a few things that made me think, ""Wait, this might be decent."" There are some cool shots. I enjoyed the family dynamic and the little boy is hilarious.
But then it drops right back down to being unbearably low-quality. The shark attack scenes are awful. Every ""horror"" element fails. We start to see how horrendous the acting is by the two leads when the scene requires yelling. My jaw literally dropped at a couple of the performances.
Worst of all, it becomes unbelievably stupid. Throughout. I'll give one example from the very beginning. They plan a trip to a town but when they arrive, the hotel is closed down, as is most of the town. There are shady people lurking around. It's clearly unsafe. Instead of driving his family somewhere else, they get out and try to get directions to a restaurant from some shady people. They leave their car and follow them on foot to this restaurant, which also has shady people. And he leaves his wife and children while he goes to work for a few hours. It's the basis for how this entire movie happens and is, to the full extent of the word, moronic.

tt10279472;The Black Demon;paul_haakonsen;"Right, well of course I opted to sit down and watch the 2023 movie ""The Black Demon"", as I had the opportunity to do so. After all, I am a sucker for shark movies, despite the vast majority of shark movies being utter garbage. But I opted to give writers Carlos Cisco and Boise Esquerra's 2023 movie the benefit of the doubt.
And I mean, a shark movie with a megalodon, that has to be cool, right? Well, some movies with megalodons are, but just not this particular 2023 movie. Sure, I managed to sit through the entire movie, but I was not particularly entertained by the script and storyline that writers Carlos Cisco and Boise Esquerra had put together. It was just, hands down, a bit too silly and preachy.
I wasn't familiar with the cast ensemble in the movie, aside from Josh Lucas, Jorge A. Jimenez, Héctor Jiménez and Julio Cesar Cedillo. The acting performances in the movie were actually fair enough, despite the fact that the actors and actresses had very little of anything proper to work with.
Visually then ""The Black Demon"" was adequate. The megalodon was nicely enough rendered by CGI, though it wasn't really as much on the screen as I would have liked it to be, much less actually expected it to be with ""The Black Demon"" being a shark movie.
There are far better shark movies out there, and ""The Black Demon"" came and went without leaving as much as a ripple on the waters in which it swam and ultimately sank. This is not a movie that I will recommend you to rush out and get to watch. Nor is it a movie that I will ever return to watch a second time.

I really felt like I was watching either a movie that wasn't quite finished, or I was wasting my money on a story that would have been a poor choice on Tubi. Too much droning on and on about legends and not enough action from the shark ...this was supposed to be a movie about a shark, a demon shark, or a megalodon so where is the action from the shark? This was one of the worst examples of storytelling I have EVER seen! Save your money on this one, because it is bound to show up in the bargain bin at Walmart very soon. I drove home after seeing this movie and even though nothing happened on the way, it was a better story than this trash told. The Black Demon didn't live up to expectations by even the smallest margin. Did someone forget to finish writing the script? I kept waiting for it to get better but it just kept sinking deeper into the hole. Maybe having a story focusing on a megalodon, an oil rig, a family, a Mexican legend, and something about little men in a boat was a bit too much to deal with in the time it took for this movie to sink lower than Sharknado, but Sharknado didn't come out as a serious movie. Not a lot of shark and too much back-and-forth banter in Spanish and English set the tone for people to get tired of reading the dialogue and missing the action.

The shark is barely on screen, the visual effects team must have been on a very tight budget. I say this as they remind me of the effects you may have seen in movies such as Sharknado...
Acting... I'm sure there is some in the film. After all, it is an hour and forty minutes long. So you'd think with all that time they'd find time to actually get some acting done. Wrong.

Grade B 2. The plot: It was alright. A small twist in it. I could see this having a different ending a few ways. Grade B 3. Acting: It was hit and miss. Possibly due to the writing. Don't even try to sell me that 50 shades would have been a better movie with Sir Anthony Hopkins in his Prime with Helen Mirin go cast. Actors can only do so much with the role. Grade C+ The wife, and Son are probably the most believable acting in this.
4. CGI SFX: B It was better than anything The Asylum ever did, but yes it's not the MEG and it's not Jaws and it doesn't have to be.
Over all grade with no Zach Galifianakis-Alan mathematical questions in a casino is a B + cause I like shake movies. To score an A though it's tough to come close to Jaws. Even Bruce the shark for all the issues looks like something you'd NEVER want to see in the open ocean.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur108410151/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9027248/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-01
tt10279472;The Black Demon;frank-liesenborgs;"""The Black Demon"" emerges as a film that, while not a masterpiece, manages to evade the label of mediocrity. The script holds promise, yet it struggles to seamlessly interweave the realms of Aztec mythology and contemporary environmental issues. The performances are competent but lack standout moments. The cinematography treads on familiar ground, while the soundtrack fails to leave a lasting impression. Regrettably, the special effects falter, failing to evoke the desired impact in most scenes. If there is a glimmer of brilliance, it resides in the seasoned talents of Mexican actor Julio Cesar Cedillo, who breathes life into the character of Chato, one of the two survivors clinging to the rig's remnants upon the arrival of Paul Sturges, portrayed by Josh Lucas. Chato's camaraderie with his loyal companion, Junior, portrayed by Jorge A. Jimenez, offers a delightful alliance against Paul Sturges when he begins spewing vaguely xenophobic rhetoric, echoing the frustrations of foreign communities devastated by hollow promises of prosperity from opportunistic corporations. Additionally, the narrative tantalizes with glimpses of events preceding their arrival at the oil rig, leaving us yearning for a deeper exploration. ""The Black Demon"" may not excel in any aspect, yet it avoids plummeting into the abyss of disappointment. A rating of 4 out of 10 seems apt, and if you find yourself in need of diversion, perhaps it warrants a casual viewing. However, if there are other options, it may be best to steer clear of this one.";4;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57396250/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9102539/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-06-05

There is very little to take away from this aside from, perhaps a convincing oil rig - if that's your thing. The acting commemorates and is oftentimes surpassed by your traditional hallmark film and quite frankly if you're in this for a AAA monster shark fest you'd probably only enjoy this if you're big on Sharnado, but even then - Sharnado likely still has more screen time.

The characters were kinda bland, but likable at least. The visuals and CGi actually looked very well done considering the budget looks much less than your typical summer blockbuster. The acting was overall pretty decent.
The only real negatives I had was it essentially being just another typical ""environmentalism-we're-destroying-the-planet"" messaging type of movie, but I guess that's what we've come to expect now.

This is a low budget shark movie, sort of like-but not as good as-The Meg. Josh plays an oil rig safety inspector that is charged with checking on a rig in Baja, Mexico. He brings his family along to have a mini vacation while he is working, since it shouldn't take him that long. His family is Spanish and he says that they can reconnect with their Spanish roots. Fernanda plays his wife and Venus is his daughter. When Josh gets to the rig, he discovers Julio-a worker-that says everyone has left because of a beast that is attacking the rig and he couldn't get off. The beast is a Megalodon. Julio tells them that the beast is a vengeful god trying to set nature right by destroying the rig so Josh has to find a way to get everyone off the rig and to safety. The Black Demon is the name the locals have given to the Megalodon. There is some gobble_de_goop message about rich oil tycons taking advantage of the local population just to make money-which is probably true-and the shark is not shown very much.

tt4873118;Guy Ritchie's The Covenant;FeastMode;"Guy Ritchie's The Covenant is a great movie with an interesting story on an important subject matter. It has some intense action scenes and many moments of suspense. The music is fantastic, elevating every scene. That's now three movies where I've noticed a great musical score by composer Christopher Benstead, along with Wrath of Man and Operation Fortune.
Jake Gyllenhaal gives a great performance as usual. The surprise stand out is Dar Salim, who did a great job of getting me invested in his character and wellbeing. I wish Antony Starr (The Boys, Banshee) had a bigger role, but it was cool to see him have scenes with a star of Gyllenhaal's caliber. He's such a great actor and I continue to wait for him to get major movie roles.
I'm impressed with the subject matter covered here. It's so sad and needs to be addressed. It's not the first time the American government has broken promises or shirked responsibilities resulting in catastrophic outcomes for the people who put their trust in them. Some people will immediately call you unpatriotic for even bringing this up. But wrong is wrong, regardless of who does it.

tt4873118;Guy Ritchie's The Covenant;eddie_baggins;"The least Guy Ritchie film Guy Ritchie has ever directed and I mean that in the nicest way possible, The Covenant (or officially Guy Ritchie's The Covenant for those that may not have known otherwise) is the British director's second box office bomb of 2023 but unlike Operation Fortune this Afghanistan set war thriller is Ritchie on top form, delivering a thrill a minute Hollywoodized romp that is one of the most well-rounded of the directors recent works.
A far cry from the likes of Snatch or The Gentleman, The Covenant is Ritchie dialling many of his trademarks way back while still managing to embed his Jake Gyllenhaal vehicle with the same type of energy, editing wizardry and character quirks that made him one of the most well-liked directors in the industry.
A completely fabricated tale inspired by work of local Afghani interpreters during the allied occupation of the country that lasted 20 years from the early 2000's until recent times, The Covenant is a white knuckle experience that follows Gyllenhaal's committed and no fuss Sergeant John Kinley and Dar Salim's (in a real breakout role for the performer) local interpreter Ahmed on a treacherous journey behind enemy lines when a seemingly routine operation their squad heads out on turns into a deadly battle to survive.
Delivered by the drone discovering Ritchie, backed by a rollicking score from composer Christopher Benstead and founded around the charismatic and committed turns from its two leads, The Covenant is far from a typical American war movie that is far more concerned with its characters than endless firefights and preaching and while those moments come and are undeniably well-staged by Ritchie and his team, its the small moments that make The Covenant more than just another big-budgeted Hollywood thriller.
Another addition to his wildly unpredictable and enjoyable new career phase that has moved on from quiet Oscar contenders and the odd bigger project to fully fledged Michael Bay/Road House remake era, Gyllenhaal brings his A-game here as Kinley and whether its shouting at an unfortunate phone operator or quietly pondering recent traumatic events in the wilds, Gyllenhaal is typically solid here and Salim matches him with the quiet but feisty Ahmed, both actors creating a likeable double bill of players that are hard not to be captured by.
A perfect Ritchie film for long time fans or those that may have never previously enjoyed his unique stylings or creativity, The Covenant may be easy to dismiss on face value but it's top notch Hollywood film-making in many ways and deserving of a much bigger audience than it was afforded in its cinematic run.
Final Say -
A rip-roaring war thriller with great lead turns that rarely lets up across a two hour runtime, The Covenant is in many ways a new type of film for Guy Ritchie that marks a new potentially exciting career move for the director to prove he's more than what many have pigeonholed him to be.

tt4873118;Guy Ritchie's The Covenant;Top_Dawg_Critic;"When Guy Ritchie out-Guy Ritchie's a Guy Ritchie film and finally again gives us the great filmmaking that made Guy Ritchie a great filmmaker. I can actually forgive Ritchie now for his Operation Fortune nonsense.
The first hour of this film alone was a great war-action film. It could've ended at that hour and I would've been fully satisfied, impressed and entertained. Then we get the bonus last hour of a separate recon and rescue mission mostly undertaken by one soldier, another epic film on its own.
Combine both stories, and you get a flawless film from every aspect, and one that is timely and hits home with a reality check on a bond, a pledge and a commitment. From the stellar directing to the near-perfect screenwriting (aside from nicknaming soldiers in the opening scene with ridiculous names, when those same soldiers become insignificant after half an hour into the film), excellent cinematography, spot-on score - especially the last 15 mins, and stellar casting with outstanding performances by everyone especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim. The running time and pacing were perfect - I actually wanted more. The two hours were pure adrenaline as the remarkable and highly emotional journey unfolded. This film had everything and more, and even some surprising laugh out loud moments: I like what you did with your hair.
Alas, Guy Ritchie just out-Guy Ritchied, a Guy Ritchie film. Sheer brilliance from every angle. An epic must see film, and a well deserved 10/10 from me. This one will be in my all-time greatest films collection for sure. It has a hook in me. One that you cannot see. But it is there.

tt4873118;Guy Ritchie's The Covenant;zkonedog;"Though I am most certainly a ""dove"" when it comes to my opinions on war and the military industrial complex, I also recognize that it is important to hear the stories of the individuals who do choose to serve in the armed forces, as their bravery is beyond question. An actor like Jake Gyllenhaal certainly draws me to projects like this, and here teamed up with director Guy Ritchie ""The Covenant"" is a film that subverts expectations at every turn but ultimately ends up being better for it every time.
For a very basic overview (one that will include some spoilers simply by nature of the film's changing arcs), this movie tells the story of Master Sergeant John Kinley (Gyllenhaal) in the later years of the Afghanistan war (roughly 2018). Kinley's company is assigned an interpreter--Ahmed (Dar Salim)--who is an expert at his craft but often takes matters into his own hands (very strong-willed, in other words). After a series of relatively normal (if inane) patrols for Taliban weapons, one such outing goes south quickly and both Kinley & Ahmed are left stranded. With a wounded Kinley on death's doorstep, Ahmed's heroic survival efforts lead to their safety. Kinley survives and is sent back home--but then discovers that the visa promised to Ahmed & family has not been executed. In extreme emotional torment at this treatment of his literal savior, Kinley tries to navigate the military bureaucracy but realizes that he may have to return to Afghanistan to get the job done himself.
One of the clear hallmarks of ""The Covenant"" is how it never quite turns out to be the movie you expect. At first, it presents as a pretty standard ""root out the bad guys"" flick. Then, it transitions into an escape/survival mission. When that comes to a close, there are a solid 45-or-so minutes of runtime left, those being devoted to Kinley trying to honor the bond he (and the U. S. military, by extension) made with Ahmed that isn't being honored. In less capable hands this shifting could be disastrous, but Ritchie executes it nearly flawlessly.
It helps, of course, to have the extremely talent (yet seemingly still always a bit underrated) Gyllenhaal in the leading role. Not only can he more than pull off the action/stunt sequences convincingly, but his tremendous everyman, character-actor persona carries the back portion of the film. Viewers are utterly dependent on identifying with Kinley's emotional torment at the thought of Ahmed not being properly treated, and Jake has no problem making that happen.
Finally, the over-arcing message of the film is subtle enough to not be over-bearing in any way but also present just enough to not seem vapid. Though portraying the horrors (both physical and psychological) of combat, it also muses upon the experience of establishing a military presence in a country, making commitments to those societies, and then ultimately leaving and seeing much progress lost. In this way, ""The Covenant"" is a deep-thinking film without any pompous or deep-thinking speeches to pull it off.
To be honest, I had nothing other than Jake G. And positive word-of-mouth drawing me to ""The Covenant"". But I'm glad I saw it, as it was a fascinating glimpse in the Afghanistan war both in micro and macro capacities.";9;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7826013/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9047187/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-10
tt4873118;Guy Ritchie's The Covenant;benjaminskylerhill;"In this straight-faced turn from Guy Ritchie, the pacing is certainly unorthodox, as over half the runtime is dedicated to set-up for an unexpectedly brisk final act. But all of it was so thoroughly investing that it didn't bother me.
And although a great deal of that set-up feels too rote, too similar to the many other war films seen in the last 20 years, The Covenant quickly carves out a thoroughly distinct feel for itself as it establishes its central theme of the indebtedness that comes with a spiritual bond people feel to each other.
Gyllenhaal is great as always, but the show-stealing star of this film is Dar Salim as Ahmed. He gives this film its emotional teeth and causes its hook of tension to sink into you and not let go till the end.
The pulse-pounding musical score and Ritchie's refreshingly restrained direction allow this film to truly have far more staying power than most run-of-the-mill war films.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117768316/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9008263/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-04-21
tt4873118;Guy Ritchie's The Covenant;gillespiesan;"I no idea how strongly Guy Ritchie genuinely feels about the grave wrongs that the US and UK military have done to interpreters in both Afghanistan and Iraq in recent conflicts but, if The Covenent is anything to go by, he's pretty pissed. And rightly so. The promises made to these individuals in an effort to get them to behave against the best interests of both them and their families needed to be honoured. In this story and in many real life cases, they weren't. That is shameful.
Jake Gyllenhaal is his usual reliable self, turning in a performance dripping in both commitment and duty. He's a good man and he's gonna do the right thing, no matter how far that necessitates he goes. Dar Salim - a new name to me - is an utter revelation as Ahmed, the bitter but pragmatic interpreter who puts his life on the line countless times to...yes, do the right thing.
The impact that war and each other have on these men's lives is at the very heart of this story.

tt4873118;Guy Ritchie's The Covenant;frank-liesenborgs;"Guy Ritchie has done it again with his latest movie, ""The Covenant."" This movie is a cinematic masterpiece that leaves a lasting impact on the viewer. With its powerful storytelling and exceptional performances, it's no surprise that many are hoping it will receive an Oscar nod. The film's themes and message are so overwhelming that they stay with you long after the credits roll. It's a testament to the filmmakers' skill that they were able to create such a powerful and memorable experience. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a strong performance, as expected, but the real surprise is Dar Salim's portrayal of Ahmed. He manages to draw the audience in and make them care about his character's fate. The movie is based on a heartbreaking true story that sheds light on the consequences of broken promises and the failure of the American government to uphold its responsibilities. It's not just about a bond between soldiers, but also about the integrity of the promises made to people who trusted and put their lives on the line for us. The film tackles the horrors that the people of Afghanistan have been facing, especially those who were promised visas to America and who risked everything to help rid their country of religious extremists. However, when the time came for the US to honor its commitment, we failed to hold up our end of the bargain, leaving these brave people and their families in danger. The subject matter covered in this movie is crucial and needs to be addressed. After watching the credits, I was left feeling angry knowing that after the US left Afghanistan, 300 interpreters were killed and 3000 more are still in hiding from the Taliban. Overall, ""The Covenant"" is a must-see film that delivers powerful acting, a captivating story, and a poignant message.

Knowing it was going to put their families lives on the line. And we just left them there. It's a history we have with this country.

It's different than most of his films in that it doesn't revolve around criminals or some type of crime. His films are for the most part awesome, and even though 'The Covenant' is different, it still has some of his trademarks. One thing for certain, it's now my favourite. Jake Gyllenhaal crushes it, as usual.
As far as modern war films go, as in taking place in Afghanistan or Iraq, I'd place this only behind 'Lone Survivor'. It's not based on a true story per se, which is usually par for the course when it comes to a war flick, but honestly that's okay. It's a dynamite story with two main parts that deliver in every way you'd want a war movie to. That AC-130 was something to behold.

Whether or not it's an accurate reflection of the military, and all the other hogwash people are trying to throw at it, the story is a simple one about honour and the price we pay for loyalty. I thought it was poetic, beautiful tragic, action, packed and full of poignant moments. The best line of the movie was when Jake Gyllenhaal says I have a hook in me. I felt that in my soul.

Frustrated at the depiction of the decision makers of the government that refuses to pay the debt of promising a new life in America for the translators who put everything on the line, against their own people, to support our troops.

tt4873118;Guy Ritchie's The Covenant;sadak7599;"Another extraordinary work of Guy Ritchie, this time quite contained in his characteristic stylistic touches, but maintaining his essence; still, it is easy to recognize his style in some scenes, in the way he shows the personality of the characters, even secondary ones, the quirky dialogues, rhythm and action scenes, being those the less important (and sometimes quite weak, showing maybe budget limitations) in a story focused in the ordeal and relationship of their main characters.
Are precisely the characters the strength of this long, two-movie-in-one story, which begins as the usual, even topical, war movie, quickly turning to a impressive, moving and epic story of survival, commitment and redemption, without exaggerations, facile sensationalism, wokism or jingoism.
The two main characters are absolutely glorious. Gyllenhaal gives a great performance, as expected. But Dar Salim's portrait of a hard-boiled tough, serious guy on the surface, but with a deep inner story, able to do something few people would do just because is the right thing, steals the entire movie. Both shows incredible chemistry and make an epic pair.
The secondary characters are also remarkable, and overall all of them do a great work. I would have liked that Antony Starr and Alexander Ludwig had bigger roles, but both are very good in their parts.
It is better to watch the movie without too much information, so I would recommend not to read much about the plot.

The movie has lots of action scenes (some with military heavy equipment) and quite a bit of violence. Gyllenhaal acts with quiet determination and the side characters also feel real, as does the movie's brilliant sense of place.
The Covenant is also an indictment of JoeB.'s administration incompetence that resulted in 300 interpreters being killed by the Taliban and over a thousand still hiding.

There is no need to explain anything to us. Guy Ritchie manages to show us a story in such a nuanced why, the the interpreter not only interprets language, he interprets eyebrow movements, the shape of some ones smile, a little look there. In fact a good interpreter is one that can interpret what is not said and what is not done in the correct way. The actor who plays Ahmed was absolutely engrossing, he was able to draw us in and care about who story merely by the way he shows us, not even what he says and does, I really hope he gets recognition for this film, maybe even a Best Supporting Actor Nod. Jake Gylenhall was flawless as always. You felt the hook that was in him, like it was a real physical thing and he heeded to take out, otherwise he would not live in peace and be only half a man by not fulfilling his commitment, a commitment not spoken about it words but in sacrifice.

tt4873118;Guy Ritchie's The Covenant;darkreignn;"Guy Ritchie's ""The Covenant"" is hands-down one of the best films of 2023, offering a true-to-life story that captures the grit and intensity one wants from war films, with all the elements audiences have come to expect, and then some. This movie has everything, from nail-biting action scenes to heart-wrenching moments of emotional resonance, and the acting from everyone involved is simply impeccable - don't even get me started with Jake Gyllenhaal's Oscar-worthy performance. If you're a fan of war films or just appreciate good storytelling, ""The Covenant"" is a movie that you won't want to miss; with its masterful blend of action, drama, and emotional impact, this film delivers everything that audiences crave in a war flick, leaving viewers completely satisfied.
After delivering his first masterpiece of the year with ""Operation Fortune,"" Guy Ritchie has once again hit it out of the park with ""The Covenant."" This film is truly a work of art from start to finish. From the captivating storyline to the expertly crafted tension, to the masterful filmmaking, this movie is a 10 out of 10, and I can say without a doubt that it will leave you in absolute awe. So, what works? Everything.
""The Covenant"" is full of impressive elements, but the performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim are by far the standout. Each actor brings a level of intensity and believability to the screen that is simply unparalleled, and Gyllenhaal's monologue to his wife in particular is a powerful moment that will leave you stunned by his acting prowess; whether you're a fan of Gyllenhaal or just appreciate great acting, his performance here is undeniably one to witness. The movie itself is worth the price of admission just to see Gyllenhaal's performance, and it's clear that he is a man who knows how to completely embody a character. However, if you're here to see a war film, you're most likely looking for action, and this movie delivers.
One of the most impressive aspects of ""The Covenant"" is its breathtaking action sequences, which were largely bloodless and yet incredibly intense, suspenseful, and brutal. The fight scenes, which lasted an extended period of time, kept me on the edge of my seat, and I left the theater feeling a rush of adrenaline from the sheer intensity of the action. Guy Ritchie's incredible directing style comes through in each fight scene, making them visually stunning and incredibly engaging. From the visceral knife fights to the intense shootouts, there's never a dull moment in ""The Covenant's"" action sequences, and the excitement only builds as the movie progresses. Whether you're a veteran action fan or looking for something new and exciting, ""The Covenant"" offers an unparalleled experience that will leave you breathless, especially when coupled with the soundtrack that literally had my heart beating out of my chest.

The story, the acting, the directing, the music, and the action - everything is top-notch, combining to create a gripping, intense, and emotionally compelling experience that is sure to leave an impression on viewers. From the first scene to the last, ""The Covenant"" keeps you on the edge of your seat, leaving you feeling completely satisfied and wanting more.

tt4873118;Guy Ritchie's The Covenant;GusherPop;"Guy Ritchie's ""The Covenant"" is a big, explosive Afghanistan-set war flick that plays more like the second half of its title. It follows a rugged American Sergeant named John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his Afghan translator Ahmed (Dar Salim) who live with a tacit agreement. Through Ahmed's work, he and his wife (Fariba Sheikhan) and child will be given visas to the United States. The movie operates best as a quiet, taut character drama that tests America's failed promises to the Middle Eastern country and its people. The Covenant is an honest portrayal of American exceptionalism, but Ritchie eventually awakens from his stupor and pushes the film into gonzo territory. It is an interrogation of the hollowness of American exceptionalism. The opening scene of ""The Covenant"" shows the dangers involved in the recovery of explosives or weapons of mass destruction. Kinley and his men, a team specializing in the recovery of explosives or weapons of mass destruction, are conducting roadside checks when a bomb is detonated, killing the translator and two other soldiers. When Ahmed arrives to fill the vacant position, his job is merely a paycheck, but he is more attached to bringing down the Taliban than he lets on. Guy Ritchie's ""The Covenant"" is a muscular, overwrought war film that fails to provide a revealing and controlled examination of what went wrong in Afghanistan. Gyllenhaal does his best to shoulder Ritchie's tonal missteps, but the director steers the film closer to James Bond territory. The explosions go bigger, the slow motion goes slower, and the bullets seem to fly further in a final set piece placed atop a dam. When black site contractors use an AC-130 gunship to help Kinley and Ahmed, should we be grateful for the overwhelming firepower on display or rightfully horrified? When the credits roll, should we be touched or haunted? Ritchie's promise of a revealing and controlled examination of what went wrong in Afghanistan is a promise that Ritchie can't keep. The Covenant is a melodramatic melodrama that tells the story of America's failure to use up their ally and then cut them loose when they are of no more value. It is based on the reality that America promised one thing, only to use up their ally and then cut them loose when they are of no more value. The film's second half also devolves into Kinley, now back home in America, trying to obtain visas for Ahmed and his family. Ritchie tells of a reality that sees America promising one thing, only to use up their ally and then cut them loose when they are of no more value. His wife Emily Beecham is merely a supportive spouse, and Kinley becomes a character based more on shock value than aching, organic feelings.";9;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur59184301/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9013280/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-04-23

The acting is uniformly very good, from the stars to all the people, especially the wife and the commanding officer, but even the children, as well as the Afghans. It's not a war movie but at its heart it's a film about your duty to one another - a wife to her husband (wonderful scene), a sargeant to his commanding office (another wonderful scene), and one man to another who went through horrendous experiences to survive.
The only reason I give it a 9 instead of a 10 is that in places the direction slows down. That 's such a funny thing since at other times the direction is truly great. But to me a 10 means it's always great, and there are a few places where it lapses.

tt4873118;Guy Ritchie's The Covenant;isaactooner;"This movie had its hook in me. Captivating, brutal in its truths, moving. Best film I've seen in a while.
I'm a fan of a few other Guy Ritchie movies, my favorites being The Man from U. N. C. L. E. And Sherlock Holmes. This film is very different in that it is serious in tone, realistic, not whimsical at all. Yet, there is a subtle stamp of creative intentionality woven into the directing and cinematography that elevated this. It's risky to put your name on a film, but he chose a great one.
Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim were incredible. The directing + acting of the main characters together works so well. Many of the greatest moments are sans dialogue, and some lines really stand out as well, the quoted one above being part of several pieces of dialogue or monologue that are enrapturing. If I were to deliberate over watching it again, this is what would encourage me to.
The action shots are great and fairly realistic, but what sets apart this film from other war movies is that it isn't just another war movie. It may still be U. S.-centric in its main character and POV, but The Covenant does a good job at honoring the local interpreters who risked their and their families' lives to help those fighting the Taliban. A lot of the dialogue is in Afghani languages (maybe Dari or Pashto), showing just how out of water the U. S. soldiers are. A couple enlightening Afghan cultural elements are included, which I appreciated.
Tying in history to this fictional story are the on-screen notes at the beginning of the film about the start of the war and the involvement of interpreters, and the notes at the end of the film about the 2021 U. S. withdrawal and the subsequent killings of many former interpreters by the Taliban. This is recent history. Then there are the real photos of soldiers and interpreters together during the credits that shouldn't be missed (some of their faces obscured for safety reasons).

After an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.
The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.
What I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.

tt3915174;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish;GusherPop;"""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the ""Shrek"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. ""The Last Wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original ""Puss in Boots."" Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado's film. The film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""The Last Wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying.

Puss in Boots has returned! I absolutely love movies that stick to what they are good at and don't try to overextend story lines that aren't very good. Every part of the story had its place and I didn't feel like they spent too much time on one specific part, with the exception of the main story of all the characters chasing after the Last Wish. Doug still holds the place for cutest animated dog in a movie, but Perrito was definitely giving him a run for his money. He was so pure and cute, and his dialogue was always perfectly timed. The scene with the bleeps when he gets kidnapped by Goldi and the Three Bears was hilarious and him putting his head on Puss' chest, acting as his therapy dog, was one of the cutest things I've ever seen.
Death was one of the coolest animated villains I've seen. The animation style was perfect for the action scenes and his appearances were always epic. The Ethical Bug bit was also very funny and the humor in general was great. The ending was awesome, with the rest of the crew teaming up to take down Jack Horner and realizing they already all they could ever wish for. Goldi had her family and Puss had his one life worth living. Gotta love the Gingy and Pinocchio cameos, as well as them sailing off to Far Far Away to ""catch up with some friends"".

tt3915174;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish;ericstevenson;"The last ""Puss In Boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""Shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? The story is pretty standard, as Puss In Boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. It seriously has some of the best action I've seen in a long time. I don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. It really is more like a straightforward action flick. Even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from Frame 1 to Frame...whatever.
This film does not take place before the Shrek films. We get to see some brief flashbacks with Shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. The villains are Big Jack Horner, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and a wolf. I believe a poster called this character the Big Bad Wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually DEATH). Every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. Every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.
So...who does get the wish in the end? Nobody! Everyone (except Big Jack Horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. It even begins with another sequel hook with Puss In Boots going back to Far Far Away Land. Another Shrek/Puss In Boots movie? If it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best CGI of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****";10;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66601046/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8757526/?ref_=tt_urv;2022-12-26
tt3915174;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish;3xHCCH;"Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. After his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. When he woke up, Puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. At first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking Wolf (Wagner Moura) made Puss decide to retire from adventures.
While living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, Puss learned about a Wishing Star from the family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) who were looking for it. Puss decided to search for the Star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. Along with Puss on his quest were his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (Harvey Guillen).
This sequel to the first ""Puss in Boots"" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. There is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. On top of the 3D computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2D artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in ""The Bad Guys""), especially noted most prominently in the character of the Wolf, and even in Puss during their showdown fight scenes.
The voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. Antonio Banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of Puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in ""Shrek 2"" (2004). Selma Hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief Kitty Softpaws, who held a grudge against Puss. Florence Pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in Goldilocks's voice.
Like before, the characters Puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. The choice for main antagonist was Jack Horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. He was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. There were a trove of Disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland and Jiminy Cricket.
Very notable in this latest Dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. Only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a Dreamworks animated film. The language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. As the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the Wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.
PS: The new DreamWorks Animation opening logo precedes this film. It was quite nostalgic to see the DreamWorks boy seeing famous DreamWorks characters old an new -- like Toothless, Po, Boss Baby, a Troll, the Bad Guys and of course, Shrek with Fiona and Donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4294858/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8723832/?ref_=tt_urv;2022-12-08
tt3915174;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish;Genti25;"This is genuinely one of my favorite films of the year. I hope it gets real recognition and people don't dismiss it as ""just an animated film"".
I've always liked DreamWorks films, with my favorite being How to Train Your Dragon 2, but after rewatching the first Puss in Boots movie, I wasn't expecting much for this sequel, eleven years after. I like the first installment for sure but it's certainly a lot simpler in story than I'd prefer. This one however, has such a rich emotional aspect to it that I truly felt something during it.
There were also certain scenes involving a wolf character that were quite creepy. I think kids will have a lot of fun with this movie, but at the core this is a story about family and understanding the value of things and/or people who are in front of you already. And that's a message that every person of any age can get something out of. The voice acting is top-notch and the animation is such a ridiculous step-up from the last time. This is such a cool direction to take this sequel into and I dug it all the way through.
There's really not much negative to say other than the ending feels like it should have been slightly more concise, but that's it.

tt3915174;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish;siggirules;"I did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, I've seen the main Shrek movies but noon of the other Puss in Boot's spin-offs. I was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!
The story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. Between the melanchonic Puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.
The two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. First of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first Shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. While the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.
Secondly, while Disney/Pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished CGI style, Puss in boots goes full Into the Spiderverse once a fight breaks out. Glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. Especially Puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.
While not entirely original, the Puss in Boots: The Last Wish combines the edgy humor of Shrek with the visual wonders of Into the Spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to Logan than any other animation I can think off. Oh and just in case (not that I personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception.";9;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur109158546/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8720741/?ref_=tt_urv;2022-12-07
tt3915174;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish;Avwillfan89;"I was not at all interested in watching this film. As most of the animated movies from the major studios, especially from DreamWorks have been extremely dull and very samey. I can't think of a good one that I've seen since How To Train Your Dragon 2.
But then I read all of the brilliant reviews and decided to give this one a go. And to my surprise, it was definitely a welcome change.
Puss gets an existential crises when Death (AKA the Big Bad Wolf) comes for his last life after Puss has frivolously wasted his 8 other ones. It's interesting how dark it gets in these scenes, with Puss, who has never been afraid of death, gets scared and has a wakeup call. And learns to value life and the lives of others a bit more.
Although it doesn't go as far as I thought it would when it came to heavy themes and character development, it certainly reminded me of the good old days of DreamWorks animation. So I absolutely consider this film a step in the right direction for this studio.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22066568/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8816234/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-01-21

Incredible on every front.
The animation is incredible. I'm beyond thrilled that Dreamworks decided to ditch the hyper-realistic animation style, and just went for a style that would perfectly represent the emotions and craziness that this movie needed.
The characters, EVERY SINGLE ONE, was so fleshed out, and they all felt like they had a purpose being there. We didn't get the usual Shrek style, Grimm fairytale cameos for no reason, on the contrary, they all played an important role in the story, and in the overall message.
This movie also had me so emotional, no spoilers, but it's the way the creators handle their characters, with such sincerity and heart.
Finally, the action, and the plot itself, it was go go go from the get go, i haven't seen a more well paced film all year, i think that is my favourite part of the dilm (Avatar 2 could take some notes)

tt3915174;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish;nicolasroop;"Seems that these days all the animated kids movies are more or less the same, with very few exceptions in recent years and it's grown tiresome. It's always potty humor and/or a weak storyline that either has adults rolling their eyes or falling asleep. This is one of the exceptions.
With pitch perfect voice acting from all parts of the cast, to the way it makes old story concepts feel relatively fresh and funny again, this one is a winner. Best of all was the film doesn't rely on low brow, toilet humor to sell it's laughs. My favorite of which came from a certain play on Jiminy Cricket that I'm sure will have you in stitches.
The animation had me a bit underwhelmed which is why I deduct a star, but that is subjective, so I leave that bit up to the viewer to decide for themselves. For me, when the action gets going, it felt glitchy and incomplete, but some people might enjoy that style.
Overall, I highly recommend this one when it releases later this month. It's definitely a film that both kids and parents will find entertaining and enjoyable. I know I enjoyed it.

Personally, the movie was very fitting. Like Puss, I'm also trying to find out who I am and who I want to be in life. This was our journey.
The stories have great connections romantically, between rivals and newcomers. The stories are about bringing all of us together despite what happened in the past.

tt3915174;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish;Entertainmentsparadise;"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish provides a fun adventure with meaningful lessons and tons of vibrant action. Donde está la Leche?
The first 30 minutes of the movie are filled with your typical Puss as he sings, dances, and fights with his ever-so-charismatic yet cocky personality. He is quickly humbled when he finds out he needs to be more careful with his life, and this is where I was instantly hooked.
Then enters the big bad wolf, from the wolf's menacing character design, skin trembling voice to the life-threatening fighting style. Wolf was one of the fantastic antagonists. I questioned whether this would be too much for the younger audience because the wolf's scenes struck fear in our beloved Puss. Although, as a viewer, we know nothing serious will happen, I felt this was a strong enough case for the plot.
It didn't end there; we are introduced to various fairytale Characters. I am not going to spoil too much.
Overall, the movie is fast-paced, has adult humor, and represents a love story, greed, and the beauty of friendship.
Verdict: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fun time for the family; I would suggest watching it if you have younger ones. Even if you don't have younger ones and are a fan of the Shrek universe, it's worth the watch.

I can think of plenty of crummy kids' movies that illustrate the point, but I'd rather bring up a positive example-- PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH.
I cannot believe I am saying this about a Shrek spinoff, but this movie really is that good. It works on so many levels: as a high-speed comedy, all the jokes land, but as a story about mortality and the meaning of life, this film is oddly compelling and mature. The plot literally involves Puss running from the personification of death, hoping to cling to his life. In between the funny scenes, I was actually moved by the existential crisis of this cartoon cat. That's no small feat.

tt3915174;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish;pugpool10;"Alright I know what you're thinking after seeing the score of this review. ""Sequels to spin-offs of beloved franchises are pointless exercises in brand awareness! Why on earth are you giving this one a 10?!?""
Because this movie...is DIFFERENT than the others. Different in that it strives to be a funnier, deeper, prettier, bolder, edgier, (surprisingly) scarier and overall more complete experience than the original Puss in Boots film over 11 years ago, and unlike that movie holds a distinct accomplishment in simply being a darn fine animated film that stands on its own, one as good as any I've seen in the past few years.
The Shrekiverse is officially back, and judging by what DreamWorks managed to pull off here the world probably isn't ready for whatever comes next. Seriously, this gives the first two films in the franchise alone a run for their money.
Looks like The House That Shrek Built is finally back on top again.

tt3915174;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish;planktonrules;"""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a most unusual CGI film from Dreamworks. This is because although kids might like it, it's clearly intended for adults. After all, the film has very strong existential elements....things that would be mostly lost on kids.
This film starts with the usual self-assured heroism you would expect in a Puss in Boots cartoon. But then something most unusual happens...after defying death again and again, Puss suddenly realizes his own mortality, as he realizes he's used up eight of his nine lives...and soon he will die once and for all! As a result, he's now afraid to be his old dashing self. So, he goes off in search of some magical wish...in the hopes that he can regain his previous lives. But, not surprisingly, along the way he discovers so much more.
The animation is lovely and the story quite enjoyable. There really isn't much to complain about with this story...it's well made and hard not to like. It also is amazingly deep and unusual...not the usual vacuous sequel just made to capitalize on the original film's success.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2467618/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8933714/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-03-17

Death's characterizations was on point, his motivation made complete sense, and he was really horrifying, I totally understood why Puss was so afraid of him.
The side characters were all likeable. The dog was a delight, and the bear family's arc was genuinely touching with several emotional moments.

tt3915174;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish;huwbutts;"In an age when movie and TV franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (I'm looking at you, Disney), I don't think anyone was expecting much from Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - certainly not I.
After the first 5 minutes, I knew this was something special.
Firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from Arkane and Enter The Spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. The 2D elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.
The music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).
The dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. Not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling I think I've ever seen. In a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. The cast do a great job of selling them too. Goldi and the bears come out with brilliant British-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.
And then there's the wolf. This character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. His style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, I'm serious).
At a time when Disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - Dreamworks have taken on the mantle.
It made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on re-watching. Partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people knew right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. You might think I'm overselling it, but Hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.
There are those that say that Hollywood is done - I know I do. But Dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way.";10;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur9154210/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8875018/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-02-16
tt3915174;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish;rgkarim;"LIKES:
Pacing -Very good for kids and adults with short attention spans -Jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.
-Surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly -Is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.
-Fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.
Adorable Characters/Feel -New characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want -Fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.
-The feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.
-Has that element of Shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.
The Animation -It's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy DreamWorks does so well.
-The design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.
-The world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that I certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.
-And it tries new things with the style that sort of work.
-Overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than Disney for the blend of real and cartoons.
The Voice Acting: -Many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.
-Mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that SNL like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. He own the Horner character and brought some of the best lines.
-Wagner Moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the Big-Bad Wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.
-Though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.
-Pugh is okay, not my favorite role as Goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. Note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.
-Guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy Is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. It does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.
-Hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.
-Banderas takes Boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the Spanish stereotype. And yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.
The References/Jokes -The stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of Shrek.
-It's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.
-The fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.
-It feels like the first two Shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. Again, refreshing that they were able to step back.
The Designs Changes To An Extent -Creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.
-Like Into the Spiderverse? Good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that Puss does.
-Not overused, which is very good for me.
The Action At Times -Shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.
-This movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.
-The ending fight shows the potential of what DreamWorks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes I've seen this year.
The Heart -Lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.
-The movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.
-There are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. That's hard to do in many things.
-I love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.
-Have not felt this way since Shrek 2.
DISLIKES:
The Darkness -It's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.
-Caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.
-Might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.
Predictable -The lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.
-The movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.
-Kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.
Too Many Antagonists -One of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all -They do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.
-Need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.
-Several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.
The Comedy Is Still Tapered -It's starting to go back to Shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.
-Still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.
-Where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made Shrek, Shrek.
-They took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.
The Animation Changes At Times -The animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.
-The comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the Spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?
-Just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.
The Action Still Not Complete --Shrek and Shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.
-This movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.
-The stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.
-They sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.
-Often was shorter than I wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. Chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.
The VERDICT I must say, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish was a much better film than when I walked in. Perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the Shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. Animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. It evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. And it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. This film is indeed a solid return to the world and I had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. However, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. Balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance I was looking for. The movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with Puss In Boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. And the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the Shrek that we saw in the first two movies. Still, I do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things.";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8749871/?ref_=tt_urv;2022-12-22

This movie has SO MUCH to love, from BEAUTIFUL visuals/action to consistent humor that actually had us laughing to engaging characters, both old and new. Such a fun time, and so worth seeing in the theaters, though we'll definitely be picking up a copy once it's out on DVD!
Without giving too much away, there are several different antagonists in this movie that scratch all the bad-guy itches, covering the spectrum from totally hateable to horrifying to relatable and sympathetic. A great cast! Also, the magical world they came up with for this movie was awesome, with some really cool/unique features!
At first, we were a little worried about the dog character, neither of us being big fans of daffy sidekicks, but we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves rooting for him! He's hilarious, and that's coming from a cat-lover!
Several callbacks to the first Puss in Boots movie made this one feel less like a spin-off than a worthy standalone franchise, and the movie was PACKED with magical references that all ages will be able to recognize and enjoy.

tt3915174;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish;masonsaul;"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a sequel that wasn't asked for but that just makes it's surprisingly high quality all the better, a sequel that far exceeds the enjoyable original with a mature story about rejecting the fear of death and accepting that life is special because of its mortality.
You can tell that Antonio Banderas loves playing this character a lot and it absolutely comes across in his voice acting. He never sounds like he's phoning it in once and still has all the charisma and energy of the character after all these years.
Salma Hayek also has just as much energy and charm this time around and has a very natural chemistry with Banderas. Harvey Guillen could've easily become annoying with his endless optimism but that never happens and he's just so lovable and pure.
Wagner Moura is note perfect with an all time great animated villain whose threatening voice acting matches his characters visual look so well and is able to bring new life to a film that's already so alive whenever he's on screen.

tt14846026;Sisu;rioksane-02950;"This was a pleasant surprise! We have Tarantino-inspired bloody action, silent and very charismatic protagonist, beautiful imaginery from actual locations in Lapland, really good soundtrack and some innovative fighting and survival scenes, and of course Finnish Sisu.
Jorma Tommila as the leading man does a phenomenal job. He has only one line in the whole movie (an instant classic), but he is acting very well just by using his face and body.
""He is not immortal, he just refuses to die.""
Congratulations for the writer/director Jalmari Helander, the movie looks really good, flows forward easily and is overall very cool and original, despite the overused tropes of evil nazis and action. With just 6 million budget this looks much bigger.
Some nitpicks: the nazis speak English, even when talking with each other, which is kind of weird. But it makes sense for scenes with some Finns.
I really hope this gets much views all over the world.

tt14846026;Sisu;Coventry;"There aren't many directors that I monitor closely, waiting and hoping for their next film to come out as soon as possible, but Jalmari Helander is one guy I keep track off. His long-feature debut ""Rare Exports"" was one of the most uniquely original and pleasantly deranged horror tales of the new century, and even his somewhat commercialized breakthrough ""Big Game"" (starring Samuel L. Jackson as the US President crashing with Air Force One in the Finnish woods) was a lot better and more entertaining than you'd think as well.
It took Helander nearly 8 years to return with a new film. At the Brussels' International Film Festival, where ""Sisu"" premiered and Helander was a guest of honor, he explained that he spent several years working on a personal dream project of his, but unfortunately it got cancelled entirely due to Covid. Out of pure frustration, or so he says, Helander wrote the script for ""Sisu"" in barely a couple of weeks. Well, if this near-brilliant explosion of action and sheer adrenalin is what he comes up with in a few weeks, then I sincerely hope he'll still get the chance to finish his other project.
What a film! You know those movies where all the great highlights and action-packed moments already feature in the trailer? ""Sisu"" has a terrific trailer too, but there are still a few hundreds of other highlights left to discover in the film. In fact, this film is a one-and-a-half-hour trailer full of awesome moments. The comparisons I've read between ""Sisu"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Bastards"" are accurate. The extreme violence and narrative structure are identical, and both films feature lots and lots of Nazis getting killed. Everybody just loves watching Nazis getting butchered in the utmost brutal and sadistic ways, is it not?
Aatami Korpi is a lone hermit digging for gold in the most northern region of Finland during the last months of WWII. When he hits the jackpot, he loads up his bag with pure gold and hopes to keep a low profile while heading back to civilization. When a platoon of Nazis finds out what he's carrying, though, they obviously want to steal it. But Korpi is not just a weak and defenseless recluse, or what did you expect? He's a force so determined and indestructible that only an obscure and local Finnish term for him exists.
Evidently (and also similar to ""Inglourious Bastards""), ""Sisu"" requires quite some suspension of disbelief from the audience. This man has the fighting and survival skills of John Rambo, but in combination with the indestructability of a T-1000 Terminator! Whether shot at with heavy artillery or a rope, he cannot die. He remains under water for a ridiculously long time and walks away from plane crashes totally unharmed. Is it plausible? Nope. Is it entertaining? You bet! Especially when watching in a chock-full festival theater with a thousand of outrageous horror fanatics shouting at a screen. Must-see!";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2020269/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9002988/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-04-18
tt14846026;Sisu;RightOnDaddio;"Finland. Such a gorgeous landscape even when war torn. It's 1944 and a rogue commander now wanders the Laplands looking for gold, oh, that precious and sweet yellow metal. The Second World War is rumbling to a noisy end, and still a reminder that it's there off in the not so far distance and occasionally it's even closer in the air overhead.
This elder and his really cool-looking dog (I want one!) search this ravaged world, just the two of them and a horse as well. Panning for riches.
This is a silent film for the first half hour or so, but where conversation may lack, the beauty of everything else on screen fills in those gaps rather nicely. (You'll think as you watch, I want to visit Finland. I want to live in Finland.) But this is the mid-1940's and there are Nazis being pushed out of the country at the moment and they are losing this war and their death-grip on this land and its' people.
This movie is told in six announced chapters. It's a gloriously short hour and a half. Tarantino's influence is heavy but more so from his Westerns than from Inglorious Basterds as one might think.
The kills are awesome. The fights are realistic and not like the choreographed dance fighting we see in most modern productions these days.
Though there is little dialogue as stated, it is told here in English and there are no subtitles.
The action sequences are breathtaking and hearten back to Raiders of the Lost Ark.
I'm serious!
This is a good story and it is timeless.

tt14846026;Sisu;h79423;"Sisu is a complicated concept. In a way it is pure stoic perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, but it is important to note that it is not just determination. It is also cleverness, that manifests itself when you most need it. Sisu is finding the solution to a problem, no matter what. This movie is definitely about that. Aatami, our ""hero"", finds the way.
Being old enough Finn to have known many people of this generation, this isn't even that much of an embellishment.
The movie is quite simplistic. The Finnish characters don't even talk until very late into the movie (which is actually another insight into Finnish culture). You have a goldminer with gold and a company of Nazis hunting him. You can't really go wrong with this storywise. You just have to make the characters and the action interesting enough. Do they? Yes. This might me kind of mild in the age of superhero movies and the more traditional action movies copying the superhero movies, but it works. In some ways kind of refreshing to keep it all more grounded.
While this might be more meaningful to me as a Finn, I would assume that if you enjoy mid-budget action, this will be right up your alley (although, at 6 million euros, the budget was much lower than what would be considered midlevel in bigger markets).";8;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2630910/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8830960/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-01-27

Most people that I have talked to have not even heard of this movie. Luckily, I saw a trailer for it about a month ago. The word Siso is a Finnish word that roughly translates into: Courage and unimaginable determination in the face of overwhelming odds. Jorma plays the man that has plenty of Sisu. He is a former soldier that is now a prospector, looking for-and finding-gold in northern Finland in 1944. WW2 is ending and the Nazis are retreating. Aksel is an SS officer leading his men in a retreat using a scorched earth policy of burning villages and capturing girls as souvenirs-he has about 6 so far. Jack is Aksel's next in command and Mimosa is one of the captured girls. Jorma crosses paths with Aksel and things get out of control fast. Aksel wants Jorma's gold as a retirement fund from Germany-since the war is now ending-and Jorma doesn't want to give it up. The rest is over the top action with plenty of body parts flying through the air. There is even a scene where a a Nazi soldier asks if maybe Jorma is immortal-they keep trying unsuccessfully to kill him-and Mimosa tells him, No he just refuses to die! I can see this movie becoming a cult favorite.
It's rated R for bloody violence, gore and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 31 minutes.

tt14846026;Sisu;Blue-Grotto;"A lone prospector, Sisu, returning from the wilderness with bags full of gold encounters a detachment of Nazi soldiers who decide to take the gold for themselves. Sisu is no mere person however, but the human embodiment of mythic Finnish determination in the face of overwhelming odds. ""Koshi"" is the name that Russian soldiers gave to him, which means ""immortal."" In other words, Sisu is a one-man death squad. The Germans are told to let the man be and that they are lucky to be alive, but they laugh and ignore the warnings. What follows are battles on land, in mine fields, above the clouds, and under water, between devastating force and a sole, determined, and mysteriously powerful individual who stubbornly refuses to give up.
Indiscriminate killings and other violence dominate this irreverent, bloody, and enticing film. While I wish the dialogue and other aspects of the film were better, I loved the thrilling action and the explosive and cathartic retelling of this Finnish legend. Director Jalmari Helander of Rare Exports and Big Game fame, was present along with some of the main actors for this Toronto International Film Festival, midnight madness, and world premiere screening.

tt14846026;Sisu;therealjaysmoke;"First off, let me say that the cinematography in this movie is sick. The effects were amazing. It's bloody, it's unapologetically violent. But unfortunately that's all there is to it.
If you want to enjoy this movie, switch off your brains because it will insult your intelligence. The problem with such movies is that, even though it's a fictional story, they paint a picture of realness but fail to develop actual real scenarios.
The reason why movies like James Bond, Equalizer, Borne, Mission Impossible and even John Wick, to an extent, work, is because the directors created scenes which where very much believable. This movie was unbelievable from the very beginning.
All the three soldiers had to do was point and shoot which they didn't do. I don't know why they chose to fight instead. Then you had the landmine scene which was laughable. How does a horse get blow up and the rider, not a scratch? Then you have several soldiers firing randomly in one direction and they completely missed you and you didn't step on any landmine? Then you had the sniper who misses every single shot and even when using the heavy gun, he seem to get the dead guy being carried by the man, but when the dead guy is dropped, he can't get the guy himself? And you mean to tell me that the guys walking behind the trucks, couldn't see him rolling on the floor? They didn't see him kill the soldiers, enter the truck and hand over guns to the women? If there's gasoline, you check the gas tanks, no? And when they finally caught him, they hung him? Someone who could hold his breath under water for hours?! You decide not to shoot him?! And theeeeeeeennnn when you thought it couldn't get worse, he hits a MOVING plane with an axe, held onto it for it for a lift off and still managed to release the axe, pierce an armored plane with it whilst in mid air, enters the plane in time before the villain could get to him. And when the villain finally got to him and beat him to a pulp, he forgot he has a gun he can use to kill him, but rather, chose to use a rope?! Absolutely Ridiculous. And the last insult was when the plane crashes headfirst, minutes later man gets out holding his axe, unhurt, unscratched, eyes still white as snow, he rides to the bank with his gold and demands for cash.

tt14846026;Sisu;Top_Dawg_Critic;Sure, it was ridonculous and fun, but this could've easily been so much better had the filmmaker spent less time with the repetitive logic-defying suspension of disbelief with the outrageous confrontations and deadly fight scenes, and focused more on a singular theme and tone for the dramatics, with expanding on the narrative - instead of plugging in pointless chapters. You can take only so much nonsense before you start thinking if this is a war parody film. A little more dialogue and character building would've also gone a long way. Even at a mere 91 min runtime and the decent pacing, there was barely a story here to make a short film, let alone 91 mins. At least the cinematography, S/VFX and gore were top-notch though.

Overall the story was watchable. The women who the Nazis had captured added a nice touch of fight back but the story was void of any real premise. For me this was ok popcorn and nothing more.

There's a bit of naration and then 10 minutes of a man digging a hole, on his own. Apart from the occasional horse noise and dog bark (he has a horse and a dog) it's just 10 minutes of digging sounds. That's what the movie calls the first chapter.
After that there's 5 minutes of a guy riding a horse. Then suddenly Nazis start messing with the guy and decide to search through his stuff. At this point the man suddenly has the ability to take on like 6 soldiers who are all armed with pistols and machine guns and fights them off using just a knife. He can then outrun a tank on a horse while avoiding both heavy machine gun fire and tank rounds.

There were a selection of wide shots and picturesque landscapes as the main character navigated the land. I enjoyed the colors of this film that added to the grittiness of the action taking place.
The film was broken down into chapters which I thought was fine but wasn't really necessary considering there were only a limited amount of characters all following the same plot line. There wasn't much of a story to this film. Basically a guy who wants no part of the Nazi war encounters some Nazi's that want to take his gold. He fights them in order to survive and keep his gold. While that story is simple it would have worked much better if there was more character development. Perhaps starting the film off showing how the main character lived before the war. A backstory into his life with some flashbacks maybe. There just wasn't any thought put into who this man was aside from the fact that he was dangerous and people knew of him.
The look of all the characters was well done. The part of the Nazi leader was well acted and he had the look of a villain. He had the most dialogue in the film contrary to the main character who barely said a word until the end.
The action in this movie was good but it was very much on the unrealistic side of things. The main character was basically indestructible to the point where it felt like he was Superman. Once again this could have worked better if he was given a backstory of somehow possessing superpowers.

The brisk runtime of 91 minutes ensures there aren't many lulls between Nazi blood being spilled. There is copious gore from both Nazis and our protagonist's unwilling desire to die. There are even damsels in distress.
I cannot say Sisu is exactly what I expected from the trailer, because truth be told, I wasn't expecting mimicry sequences of Mission Impossible hanging from a plane, Rambo stalking with a survival knife, or the other half dozen far-fetched antics.

From covertly slitting throats while underwater to throwing landmines at unsuspecting victims and bashing heads in with military-grade helmets, the 90 minute runtime offers viewers a plethora of creative ways for our hero to demolish his enemies. And as much fun as that is to watch, I can't shake the feeling that there wasn't as much action and violence as I wanted.
""Sisu"" has a pacing problem; while offering its fair share of excitement and action, the build up to the intense, bloody scenes can feel slow, leading to some dull moments before the fireworks begin. It's a minor flaw in an otherwise entertaining film, but it's something worth noting for those who prioritize a fast pace in their action films. And honestly, it was a big detractor for me. For every scene of bloody violence, there was an even longer scene of people sitting and talking, and talking and sitting, and it simply wasn't what I wanted to see in a movie about a one man reign of terror. But, while the slow sections may not be everyone's cup of tea (they certainly weren't mine), if you're willing to sit through them, you will be rewarded with some exciting fight sequences that may be - for you - worth the wait despite the borderline excruciatingly slow buildup.
If you can overlook the slower parts, ""Sisu"" could be a great choice for those who enjoy a good Nazi-killing film that will leave you feeling satisfied and maybe even a little bit grossed out (for example, at points my own father couldn't look at the screen, and my mother gasped in terror when a Nazi soldier got stabbed in the head with a bowie knife). And while I myself wasn't a fan of the slower sections (I found myself falling asleep in the theatre at points), I can't deny that ""Sisu"" entertained me during every single action sequence - it's just a ton of fun to watch some of the most evil people on the plant get what's coming to them, so much so that I only wish there was more action than there was! My conclusion: I would've enjoyed a faster pace with more frequent action, but for what it is, ""Sisu"" definitely warrants a viewing for all of your darkest Nazi-killing fantasies.";5;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33659536/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9031722/?ref_=tt_urv;2023-05-04

tt13429928;Operation Seawolf;Top_Dawg_Critic;"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Calling this a B film would be a compliment, but this barely classifies as a C film. After 25 minutes of watching, I'm still lost as to what is happening. All there is, is a bunch of nonsense dialogue and horrible acting in scenes that simply go nowhere. This was worse than what you would see at a fifth grade drama class play. I'm not sure why this was even made, it is complete nonsense and unwatchable, I couldn't even finish it. It lacks any fluidity, is convoluted, and sloppily written and directed.
I can appreciate it's a low budget film, but having a bunch of random dialogue and scenes that don't even make a story, is pointless. I feel sorry for Grillo and Lundgren, because even they look lost in what they're supposed to be a part of. It's like ""look at this, say that, look away"" end scene. Lundgren has to walk around with a drink in his hand looking lost and aimless - I hope for his sake there was real alcohol in that glass.

tt13429928;Operation Seawolf;OzMovieWatcher;"This B-Grade movie is loaded with numerous factual errors and goofs. Rank insignia wrong, wrong uniforms and boots, office and household items that post date WW2, filmed in an obvious American submarine that is supposed to be German and on it goes.
This movie was actually available on-line in full HD, to be viewed on 3rd party streaming site about a week before the official release date. I watched it there and waited until IMBD unlocked the ""movie review"" link after the release date officially passed.
In all honesty, my viewpoint is that any movie with Dolph Lundgren made since appearing in Rocky, is rarely watchable. He has virtually no acting ability at all in my opinion. If I see Dolph Lundgren appearing in the credits of a movie, I am more likely not to watch it, since I find almost every movie with his appearances to be nothing short of disappointing.
As far as the movie goes, the storyline is believable, even though historically inaccurate. It is correct that Germany experimented with rockets launched from submarines with the intended target to be USA, German technology failed to make such a concept operational. Just google ""rocket U-boot"" to read about the failed program.
There is one scene that left me cringing.... Dolf Lundgren as a Submarine Captain Hans Kessler is inspecting his crew in a building basement. He says, ""these are not kriegsmarine"", to which the mariners all lined up in different uniforms, and some not even in uniforms (contrary to strict German regulations), start stamping their feet singing a German naval song, which is an attempt to ""carbon copy"" the same sequence in WW2 classic ""Battle of the Bulge"" with the tankers singing Panzerlied. Apart from the naval song not being inspirational to anyone not familiar to it, some of the mariners (actors) are seen with their hands in their pockets and not even singing along, not withstanding that it was sung very badly and out of tune.
Like I said earlier, the story line is believable, but as it nears the end, the story line goes off on an unbelievable tangent.
Overall, the movie is OK to watch if you are bored, but it depicts nothing accurate, nothing historical, nothing suspenseful, bad acting, bad cinemaphotography, I consider the movie as a recommendation to watch, only if your lawn grass stops growing and there is no other more exciting action to watch.
I will not say that the movie is a piece of Krap, but it may well be a significant contributor to that pile of Krap you will see popping up on the sidewalk.";1;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur90578176/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8593312/?ref_=tt_urv;2022-10-07
tt13429928;Operation Seawolf;Erik_Surewaard;"I am a big fan of both submarine movies and movies about the second world war. So with this movie - which combines both - I was really looking forward to go and watch it. And with a cast including Dolph Lundgren, what could go wrong?!
Well, the issue is that this movie has several really big issues...
First of all, it is the poor visual effects (VFX) that they used in ""creating"" ships and planes. You can so easily see that they are fake that you continuously focus on this shortcoming. Honestly, the VFX are of such a poor level that a modern game looks more realistic during gameplay than this movie.
Second, it is the way the actors speak. From the start of the movie they tend to ""germanize"" the english. And it just sounds so totally fake. Why didn't they chose for a format where the actors all speak german in only the first couple of minutes of the movie, after which they switch to english?! I have seen this exact principle being used in the famous movie ""The Hunt for the Red October"", another submarine movie where they switched in this way from russian to english.
Third, it is the very obvious mistakes that they make. For instance, they show the so-called ""Atlantic Fleet Command""-building in the USA. But you can see very clearly that the building says ""Federal Reserve"", meaning that it is a building from the central bank. With all efforts that are put in VFX, was it such a difficult task to remove the letters ""federal reserve"" from the building?! Something like that is even basic functionality in e.g. Adobe Photoshop.
Instead of wasting the production budget on expensive actors like Dolph Lundgren, it would have been way better spent towards solving the above-mentioned issues. Hiring expensive actors and neglecting the basics, seems to be some kind of recent trend. You can also see it with many - if not all - of the movies in which Bruce Willis features. There seems to be group of producers whom just prefer to spend big on actors instead of getting the basics right. And these movies do not even deserve the credit to be called ""B-movie""... I think this type of movie deserves to called something like C-movie, where the ""C"" stands for all the Cash that is literally wasted by using expensive actors.
I should mention that the storyline of this movie is quite okay. This shows that this movie had way more potential if they had just spent the budget more wisely.
This movie clearly doesn't deserve a rating that is even close to sufficient. Such scores (5/10 and above) are meant for movies that meet all the basics. To give this movie still some credit for the storyline, I think a rating of 3/10 is what it maximally deserves. Spending any time and money on seeing this movie is just a waste...";3;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur135771508/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8596548/?ref_=tt_urv;2022-10-08

Although I did plod through it until the hapless ending, There were so many things wrong with this picture, that I'd like to point out just a few.
Early in the film, the 'new' crew gets all lined up for inspection. To be ruefully honest, they all looked as if they'd just paused their Game Boys, Cell Phone games, or whatever, to get off their fat rears long enough to form some sort of 'line' for poor, unshaven, haggard Dolf Lundgren to inspect. Lundgren looks like he just finished ""Rocky IV"", and they just got the red coloring off. Not even their uniforms matched! Carry this theme to the locations, the desks & chairs, even the pictures on the wall and you will have an idea of how this film looked. Bad.
It is also way past obvious that the number of people in the film was cut to the absolute minimum. On the U. S. side, there is a guy who keeps running to the General with the latest news -- in his first appearance, he looks like he's thinking: ""Gee, I'm really in an actual movie!"". Yes, this film is THAT bad!
To be fair, making a film set in ~1945 is more difficult in 2022 then it was in 1945-1950. But still!

Any sub operating that way giving away its would be sunk in no time. There would not have been a black American bridge crew in WWII. The uniforms are poor and incorrect. The commands to steer one direction but move the rudder in the opposite is just nonsense. The Submariners might not have been clean clean shaven but the line officers would be. It makes the American Commander look like a LARP'r. During the depth charge scene there is no disruption inside the U boat even after a hit. Other reviews point out even more issues so I will not take the time here.
Added to all the flawed Naval presentation is poor character development and missed opportunities for good plot development. Overall the effects see fair, the acting is average, the plot is average to bpoor, the details are messed up, and the story telling is 100% B movie. I like U boat movies.

tt13429928;Operation Seawolf;paul_haakonsen;"As I sat down to watch the 2022 war movie ""Operation Seawolf"", I must admit that my expectations weren't exactly great. Why? Well, let's just be honest here, Dolph Lundgren doesn't exactly have a string of consequtive hit movies to his belt. But as this was a movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I opted to give it a fair chance, and thus I sat down to watch it.
Writer and director Steven Luke actually managed to put together a wholesome and surprisingly enjoyable storyline here. Sure, the movie wasn't exactly boasting and looking like a multi-million dollar production, but the spirit was there and it was actually a well-written storyline with interesting characters. So the sometimes questionable low budget feel that there was to the movie, especially in the American navy offices, was bearable.
I was genuinely surprised and entertained with the storyline that Steven Luke churned out of here. And while ""Operation Seawolf"" is not going to become a new ""Das Boot"" movie, then it was actually a good movie about submarine warfare during World War II. And the character gallery in the movie was nicely written too, detailed and layered characters.
Now, I have to say that leading actor Dolph Lundgren carried the movie quite well. And it was also nice to see the likes of Frank Grillo and Hiram A. Murray on the cast list, though they were both not utilized enough for the movie, as they only had limited time on the screen.
Something that was bothering me about ""Operation Seawolf"" was the fact that the German submarine naval crew were speaking English, with a slight German accent to it. It just doesn't really work all that well, especially not now in 2022, where other movies actually have actors and actresses speaking in the correct corresponding language of whomever they are portraying on the screen.
Visually then ""Operation Seawolf"" was surprisingly good. The CGI was good and most of the sets were good, and it definitely felt like a proper World War II movie. And I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the scenes at open sea.

There are so many mistakes that I need to see it again with my buddies and make fun of the movie.

So if you want to see a stupid movie and laugh at it enjoy.";1;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44555012/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8753076/?ref_=tt_urv;2022-12-23
tt13429928;Operation Seawolf;kingtigeroptics;"Das Boot, is the only historical film in existence with the type Type VIIC Uboot ... everything else can't compete with this type of movie
You can watch Das Boot, many times and keep fascinated.
This movie sorry, they just did not invest some time for details.
So then it becomes so fake .... No German navy uniforms all mixed up.
It make no sence. Even the Belgium U boot movie is much better.
TORPEDO is the name of that movie ... A type VIIC Uboot ... better actors scene and so on ...
This is just some stuff about a submarine has nothing to do with history, Start with real German navy uniforms speak German and not fake english German or what ever .... Is this so hard ? Then dont even try ....
U-571 seems a Type VIIC, al least thats was a litle bit ok ... but nothing cant beat Das Boot, best Type VIIC uboot movie ever !!!!!";1;https://www.imdb.com/user/ur158116074/?ref_=tt_urv;https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8636014/?ref_=tt_urv;2022-10-25
