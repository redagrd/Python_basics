Jacob B,"A wholesome, true to life film about one of boxing's heaviest hitters, George Foreman. It touches not only upon his life inside the ring but also his life outside of it. Slightly amateurish at times, the film more than makes up for it with a ton of heart. The fact that they included the faith-based aspect of his life and the relationship George has with his (and my own) Lord and Savoir, Jesus, is like a breath of fresh air in what is otherwise a vile and Godless film industry known as Hollywood. 'Big George Foreman' is a film the entire family can enjoy.",5
Ronald E,"I like ""comeback"" stories as a rule. This one is great because it is true and told with authenticity and may I say, grit. I went in thinking it probably was made for adolescents only but came away with the sense that there was a take-home message for people of any age. The story is true and the punch line is multifaceted -- from regaining his heavyweight boxing title and being the oldest man to do so, then Foreman's spiritual rebirth following his coming on hard times with nowhere else to turn but God. His mom's prayers never stopped. While the spiritual dimension is not given much detail, Foreman's story serves to point a young person who is seeking the Way, or who has lost a lot of hope, to pray. God does hear prayer.as in the Sermon on the Mount.",5
Brendon M,"It's definitely worth watching if you're a fan of George Foreman. I've always admired his spirit and been in awe of the guy for years. I still am. It's a heartwarming story well told by the cast and crew which will no doubt resonant with many people. As per usual the ‘critics' haven't rated this film favourably. But, most of us should be used to their style of critique by now. Give it a watch, I think most people will find value and enjoyment in this film.",5
P VanZandt,I grew up watching my dad watch boxing so decided to go see this cuz love true stories. Such a great movie!!! Meaningful story and so entertaining and glorifies God!,5
Tariq E,"Some movies whisk you away into the world of make-believe, some hold a mirror to society, and then there are those that invite you into a journey - a journey that spans across time and landscapes, hearts and souls. ""Foreman"" is one such journey. It punches you in the gut with raw emotion and then raises you on the powerful shoulders of hope, making you feel every high and low of the man who wore boxing gloves with the grace of a ballet dancer and carried his faith like a warrior's shield. In the boxing ring of life, Foreman, portrayed with a profound dignity by the lead actor, is a poet who weaves a symphony of punches. From his tryst with the Olympic gold to the world championship, his fists are an extension of his soul - fierce, relentless, yet sensitive. The pivotal 'Rumble in the Jungle' against Muhammad Ali, recreated in all its historical splendor, isn't just a fight, it's a ballet of human spirit and a collision of titanic wills that will leave you breathless. However, ""Foreman"" is not just about the boxing ring; it transcends it. It morphs into a story of faith, of a man finding his belief, retiring, and becoming a preacher. Here, the movie is a quiet stream of introspection, a testament to Foreman's strength beyond physical prowess. When financial hardship strikes, the narrative shifts gears, and Foreman steps back into the ring, not with a vengeance, but with a sense of purpose. His triumphant return at age 45, becoming the oldest heavyweight champion in history, is a cinematic event that will make your heart pound, your tears well up, and your spirit soar. The cinematography paints a poignant picture of Foreman's journey. The punishing intensity of the boxing rings, the calming serenity of his church, the disarray of his struggles, and the redemption in his comeback are all captured with poetic precision. The director skillfully lands every emotional punch, the screenplay is deftly crafted, and the score beautifully accentuates the highs and lows of Foreman's life. The true charm of ""Foreman,"" though, is how it makes you feel a part of Foreman's journey, his battles, his victories, and his redemption. You are in the ring with him, praying in the church with him, struggling with him, and ultimately, you rise with him. In summary, ""Foreman"" is a cinematic knockout. It's a captivating journey of a man's fight inside and outside the ring. It's a tale of faith and resilience. It's a narrative of a champion who, like a true hero, falls only to rise again. And it's a love letter to every soul that has ever dared to dream, fight, fall, rise, and find redemption in the most unexpected corners of life. So, step into the arena, feel the thrill, the pain, the joy, and the redemption, because ""Foreman"" is not just a movie to be watched, it's a life to be lived.",5
Old R,"This is not a boxing movie, more of an inspirational movie. It is a moving story of how an angry man was lost and found god. Life was still a challenge, but he stayed faithful to his faith. I watched this on VUDU. We enjoyed the movie.",5
Jan S,"Really good movie, enjoyed it way more then sth like Creed 3, just feels raw and u can feel the emotion through the screen.",5
Rudeboy23 7,"One of the best heartfelt movies I've seen in a while!! I have no idea what's wrong with the supposed ""certified critics"" but as you can see your average movie viewer loves it. Forgot those critics lol!!",5
Colin R,Packs an emotional punch.,5
tm11999 M,"i was there, but OK.",5
Andrew P,"great family entertainment ,fantastic feel good movie ,suppose RT critics have no understanding of feeling good",5
GEORGE V,It was a very inspirational movie about a young man that was going through some ruff times & made the most of it to better himself!,5
Ndaeya U,It does not take the usual approach of boxer films but it works. Foreman wasn't called Big for nothing. His story deserves a series but this film fits in what it can in the best way possible. I do not think it could be told better. Anyone thinking otherwise does not understand the genre. The cast performance also elevates the story.,5
Josephine,Loved that it was as true as could be. Forrest Whitaker should get Oscar for supporting actor.,5
Bill S,"I am kind of mixed on this movie. It had a lot of good qualities to it, an inspiring story, good use of humor, and strong overall acting. That said, the movie doesn't seem to have a lot of depth to it for a bio-pic. I came in expecting to learn a little more about Foreman and some of his life that weren't necessarily widely known. The movie also felt slow at times and then rushed at others. Perhaps it's bad editing or poor pacing, but to me the film never seems to hit a comfortable stride. Overall I enjoyed it, but it's probably better for a casual watch at home than a trip out to the theater.",5
,"This movie was alright, I wouldn’t say it was great like a lot of you are. The pace of it was very weird and kind of felt like 4 movies in one. Not the greatest boxing movie by any stretch of the imagination but good to watch if you’re interested in George Foreman’s story.",5
Jonathan,"The George Foreman character is likeable and endearing. He seems a little dumb, though.",5
Jeffrey S,Very Inspiring movie!,5
Caleb P,I saw this movie twice. You could see how God used different stories through out his life to create 1 big story that points to him. Overall I thought it was a well done movie.,5
Lynda,"Liked all of it!! The spiritual part, his born again experience, was the highlight! Acting great! Music great!",5
,Well made and very entertaining.,
STEVE S,"Could have been so much better. Was a line drawing going from scene to scene, step by step. I'm sure George's life is more interesting than this movie.",
,A really good story I loved this,
William A,Must SEE! Big George's life is a movie and not just for boxing fans,
Zemario S,This story was waaaayyyyy to good to be treated with suck lack luster. Focus on one relationship that could drive the story and allow moments to breath better vs moving from point A to point B. The source material was rich!,
Tracey B,It was nice to get a review of his life but I wish the storylines went deeper. The movie didnt get too emotional which made it hard to form a connection to George Foreman.,
Ray R,I enjoyed watching this movie. Comeback movie that made me feel good leaving the theatre.,
Demetria B,A real family-friendly movie for a change.,
Maria,This movie glorifies God,
Jack J,Great movie. Great boxer who fought his toughest fights with his personal demons.,
SanDee,It was a great movie. Will watch it again,
Sebastian M,"This is a good and heartwarming film! As a fan of boxing, and as a fan of movies based on a true story, this was a good watch. Seeing the untold story of George Foreman, from boxer to preacher, on the big screen was quite enjoyable. As a Believer in Christ, I was delighted to see a wonderful adaptation that Khris Davis displayed while acting as George Foreman. At times the movie did feel a little length; but I left the movie theater with a warm feeling.",
Kashara’s,Better than creed 3!,
Phillip and Teresa,"Excellent, The Whole Movie was Well Done, I / We Enjoyed the Soundtracks as Well! We Enjoy Jesus Christ / Christian Based Movies.",
Camisha S,It was honest and inspiring. We'll definitely see again!,
Alan C,"Loved this movie, a true life Rocky story, but much much better, what a life, what a comeback. It is a rattling good story, boys own stuff. I suspect the critics find it difficult for the simple reason that at one stage of his life George became a preacher, This is something the brain dead left can't cope with, perhaps if he had become a Woman they would have loved it.....",
Osborne Family,"We really liked the Christian part. This movie was inspiring, wholesome, educational and one of the only positive movies I've seen that will be coming to theatres this year. We laughed a lot and had a good time. This movie is well made and deserves a watch. We're glad we went to see this movie and yes it is appropriate for audiences young and old. When he was given recognition for praying for his nephew when he was born they gave him the recognition for praying for his nephew and they thanked him for it they thanked George for it for praying for it which was very nice.",
William H,Truly inspiring story.,
eddy D,"Awesome movie! Such an inspiration. Lots of love, compassion, and a big heart. Many funny moments! Will make you laugh and cry.",
Althena Cook,Very good Morton the perspective it was told. God is still on the throne!!!!,
Debra L,"True story docudrama. Finding Faith in God. You can never criticize a person's life Testimony. Therefore, the story of George Foreman's life is an inspiring story of letting God lead him to victory in the boxing world and everyday life's journey. A Must See...if you want to have forward moving impact on your life.",

Gymmie,Nice to see his story and his faith and family was very Important in his life.,

Yolonda,Awesome documentary!,
Dave H,"A wonderful depiction of an even greater real story which I had watched unfold as a boxing fan who loved to hate the grumpy, intimidating young George.

Zackalyn,My family loved this movie! A wonderful story of the great life of a great man!,

Jose,"I never knew about George Foreman and all. Its worth to watch it, though",
Miss LL,"What an inspirational movie. George Foreman proves that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to. He proves that a bad person can change. Life is all about choices.

Tracey,It was a good movie sharing alot of things I had no idea about the champ.,
Jason P,GREAT BIO MOVIE. Very Touching to show Great Perseverance in Accomplishing Life Tasks,
sharon,Great story great movie!! God had his hand on it all!! Amen!,
Jumpa23,"A glimpse of Foreman's life. I thought parts of the movie dragged a bit. Overall, a good movie with realistic ups and downs of life, for an underdog trying to succeed.",
Nol P,"Even though not nearly as iconic or as exciting, or as flashy as Ali was, I was glad to finally see a movie made on the life of George Foreman. This film really delivers nicely. A perfect running time too of just over two hrs did create a wonderful story on Foreman's rise to the title and his embarrassing loss to Ali. The documentary movie painted a picture nicely on his financial demise to his regaining of fame and the heavyweight title crown again at 45 yrs young over major heavily favored Moorer. I thoroughly enjoyed and you will too! Forest Whitaker was very good as usual too. 8 out of 10, all day long!",
E.T.,"Love this storyline! Very inspiring, very ""Rocky Balboa"" Inspiring! A feel good movie.",
Michelle c,It was inspirational,
Frances Muscatello,Absolutely loved this film! Actors were perfectly matched for roles they were portraying! Showing George's struggles in life and how Jesus always was with him and when he received Jesus all was right! His Mom and his family's Faith was a real testimony and very inspiring! Recommend to all!,
Fred A,"Terrific story. There was a lot more about George Foreman than I ever knew. Now, I know!",
,"This was a really good bio pic. I would have preferred a little bit more information about how he got involved with the people who created the George Foreman grill. Otherwise, it was decent film.",
,"Emotional, Inspirin, Clean, Spiritual, A transformed life true story, touched me inside.",
Mike,"Great story with a real script, acting and story.",
Buster J,"I don't know why people hate this movie. Sure, it may be slow paced at times, and it doesn't have star power, but it tells the story well and the actors don't do a bad job.",
TheDizzyrizzy,"This movie really packs a powerful punch! I loved it and plan on taking my family to see it again. The acting was top notch, the casting was excellent, I felt absorbed into the storyline. I am a big movie fan and this is the first movie that I have cared enough to actually review on Rotten Tomatoes. Go see it! You will be very glad you did, time well spent!!!",
Johnnie D,Many scenes were accurate and brought back memories...,
Chris,"When the public loves it (almost unanimous) and the critics hate it, you know it's a good one. The critics generally seem to give high ratings to movies where black people play slaves or victims, but that's not the case here. This is a long overdue story about a true American hero and legend. The lead actor Khris Davis gives a brilliant, award-worthy performance, as does Forest Whitaker. There were decades to cover, so they couldn't focus on the deeper details, but they did a good job condensing the highs and lows of Big George's amazing life. Lost in this is just how dominant George really was, but its not a sports movie as much as a bio. No politics or social agenda (sorry, activist/critics!), just a great story of a great man that any normal human being will love.",
Linda C,Very good story. Root for the underdog. Never give up. Laughed and cried. A must go see movie!,
Phillip L,"The casting was fairly good and the storyline was close to the way I remember. Movie got a little slow towards the end of George's first career but made up for it in the second half. Khris Davis did a great job playing both ends of the career, and the weight gain was legit. Overall, it was a better than average movie and exceeded expectations.",
keren,Loved this movie! Acting and storyline were excellent! What an inspiring story!,
James C,Everything the critics hate and all the things decent people love...,
TJ,"I thought this movie was awesome! It’s very good acting and so much awesome information about the struggle, fight, loss, victories, deception and belief in himself and then God to live a very full life to say the least!! I’m glad this movie came out it made me admire George Foreman even more!! Thank you",
Terri M,"Powerful movie. I was really inspired. A real life Rocky story about finding your own truth and self worth (in his case through his faith), and using that as your fuel.",
rob p,Great story. Very well done movie.,
Beverly,The movie gave alot of insight on what the Boxer went through to get to his success . I really enjoyed the movie.,
,"I wish Hollywood made more movies like this one. Very wonderful story, and one for all ages. Forrest Whitaker and the cast in general were fantastic. You won’t regret seeing it!",
Ella L,Excellent movie - great success story told in entertaining way. We really enjoyed it.,
Giselle Y,"It was perfect and very inspirational. Its sad that there were 6 people in the theater at 7:30 on a Saturday. Many young people were going to other movies that are violent, superficial, and offensive in so many ways. Are society is messed up, and that is way there's so much crime and violence.",
LoriBeth,"very good... closely followed his life story, but left out a lot of his shenanigans...",
Jack,It was a great story of the great George Foreman. It taught me things I didnt know about him and in the final credits the characters to real life comparison was spot on.,
sherry,It told the true story of his life,
RJ S,"Swing, miss, and down goes Foreman. Full review here: https://open.substack.com/pub/quietontheset/p/big-george-foreman-swing-miss-and?r=298wfz&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web",

Tanner E,This movie was great! Inspirational and great acting! A+,
Sandra S,We went as a family and enjoyed it very much. It had a lot of good content and it helped you to appreciate what God gives you.,

Lisa S,"Loved it, what a remarkable story! Acting was great, was entertained throughout the movie. Well done!! 👍🏻👍🏻",
Amir M,No idea why the experts would give this 46% outside of being somewhat religious movie. It's a recent enough story that most of us can relate and powerful true story that younger generation can appreciate but most importantly it is very entertaining and well acting especially powerful acting by Sonja Sohn and Forest Whitaker.,
Kenny M,I liked the movie. I thought it was great.it fell complete.,
Ryan K,I was excited at first because I love biopics but I felt like the strong religious undertone really killed it for me the plot was great and the actor playing George did phenomenal... I never knew the story of George foreman but now I am intrigued,
Winsome C,"An unforgettable true story of an American hero, George Foreman. Gold Medalist and two-time heavyweight champion. The acting was excellent and believable. I did not know George Foreman was a Christian pastor between championships that surprised me.",
Youlanda,"It was funny. Honest to history. Great, depiction.",
Kyle J,"Amazingly honest and inspirational. I'm sure it took a lot for George Foreman to be as vulnerable as he was to share his journey from rags to riches, and his way back down and up again.",
Michael W,"This sports movie was really good. Khris Davis, Forest Whitaker, Jasmine Mathews, and the rest of the cast did a fantastic job in this movie. This true story about the career heavyweight and miraculous comeback of heavyweight champion Feorge Foreman was dramatic, inspirational, and heartfelt. It's about fighting for your family and putting your trust in God. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's a definite must see.",
Cinda,"The movie was great! I learned how George Foreman became a boxer, how he became a minister, and how he survived ridicule and injustice. The acting was terrific. I do recommend that you check out this movie!",
Critics go home!,"Couldnt disagree more with the professional critics reviews of this movie and might I add the professional critics reviews almost soured me on going had my wife not talked me out of the wisdom of a bunch of left-wing, artsy- fartsy types. Youd think Id have learned by now!",
Mark R,"Not knowing much about George Foreman except that he had that grill and that he was a boxer, I went into the movie with the expectations that this was just a good boxing movie, albeit based upon someone's real life. The highlight for me was the Khris Davis transformation through the story. While I had a few wondering thoughts that some aspects of George's life were abbreviated, which made me feel that the movie was ""too good feeling"", I was quite pleased overall. I completely enjoyed how Muhammad Ali was characterized, even if it might not have been as accurate (hey it isn't his biopic). End the end, I was surprised by the movie and even more surprised to learn about the life of George Foreman.",
Tony K,I thought the boxing scenes could have been better but the story was fantastic. I think it focused a little too long on his younger years but that story was interesting as well.,
Hec R,La trama es el equivalente cinematográfico a consumir 5 kilos de somníferos y bajarlos con una Pepsi twist,
Cynthia C,I highly will recommend to family and friends. I would like to see it again!,
desi r,"It's the same story for the third time, plot was extremely predictable",
Ed S,"Excellent movie! Great story. Most ""professional"" reviewers won't like it because it has a positive religious theme.",
,Super amazing film. It teaches us the meaning of finding our true purpose in life.,
,Great acting couldn’t save the religious movie pretending to be a boxing movie. Save your money on this one.,
,"An amazing story about strength, loss and faith!",
Dr. ALi,The actual boxing was too faky not much emphasis on the choreography towards the boxing scenes.,
Bob K,"This inspirational real-life story deserves an inspirational movie adaptation. Sadly, this was a bare-bones effort all around. Was just okay.",
Luke S,"This was a very motivational story told in a sluggish, pedestrian way. The people's champ still shined through, though!",
JulieAnn G,"We LOVED this movie! It was inspiring, encouraging, and proved that anything is possible when you put God first.",
ALEXIS R,Its good movie to watch at least one time. Good storytelling.,
Peggy,"A real true story that Hollywood didn't mess up, finally! No cussing.. Great story!",
Marie78,This movie was unexpectedly excellent! It was a great watch about George Foreman’s life without any unnecessary obscenities but well acted. Please don’t skip on this beautiful film!,
Carma,"I enjoyed the true story for I did not know it. I also, liked that there was no sex scenes of same sex or couple sex. It was a clean movie. And no rightsopinions being forced down my throat",
Lenora B,"I love faith-based movies because they are TRUE testimonies of how our Lord Jesus Christ calls us to come out of our darkness and despair, and into the Light. I am so glad George Foreman shared his life's story with us (the good, the bad, and the ugly) and how God truly transformed his life to become a man, child of God. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the acting. It was great! The story of redemption and life transformation. This is a Great Movie to go See!!! The actors were are all top rated. You will not APPRECIATE this movie if you're looking for profanity, nudity, bloody-gore, and unnecessary violence, even thriller-type because it is about a man and his relationship with the Lord our God Jesus Christ! I rated this a five star after seeing this in a theater; and to me, it is! Hats off to all who made this movie! We are in some very dark days. Never mind the critics. See this movie for yourself and enjoy. I brought my older grandson who's a teen to watch this.😊👌",
Pudge,Very well done . No profanity and good actors. The story line was excellent.,
Cristal K,"I really enjoyed this movie. It had a nice pace and some laughs. It was a true life story that had struggles, good fights, WINS, family, betrayal, and then George Forman gives it one more try and succeeds. I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. The main actor was a good choice. A nice wholesome movie.",
Robin,I loved the movie. Forgot a lot of what happened back then. I was a big Ali fan in back n the day.,
Nancy C,"Well told story of hardships faced in his childhood and how George allowed his anger to control him. His boxing success allowed him sink into self made celebrity status of materialism. His life was redeemed at a low point as he found his real purpose for life. A true testimony on how God changes hearts. Wonderful true story but too graphic, but then, what's is boxing but punches and blood?",
Carol L,Great movie of George Foreman and very entertaining and positive. A must see!! I will go see it again!!,
Tamika,"I loved this movie, leaned so much. it was also very inspiring and motivating to work hard to earn what you want.",

judy b,"Great use of real fight clips, enjoyed the human side. of a boxer",
,"I liked it. Wasn’t perfect, maybe missing parts that the real George Foreman wanted to emphasize but kept politically PC. It’s OK.",
suz g,"Excellent Bio of Foreman's life, the struggles, challenges and triumphs. Time flew by - I would see this movie again. George Foreman is the Cinderella Man of his era. Inspiring, interesting - every single actor was believable and memorable. The boxing sequences were skillful and authentic. Great movie whether you're a boxing fan or not.",
deannabushcharternet L,I learned so much about Georg Foreman’s life and story. Really interesting and great acting.,

Patricia W,I liked all the action of the boxing matches and the strong faith message.,
Russ B,"Great movie, great story, Great cinematography",
Sharo'n,It was awesome. Such a good story. Great soundtrack as well.,
SkyRo P,"#MovieReview #BigGeorgeForeman #GeorgeForeman So the movie is VERY long, the movie seemed very promising in the beginning and was engaging I enjoyed the fights and the bantering with Ali that made the movie feel like it had some edge and excitement. The film then fell off the wagon and got very long, the longest part with the second coming of Foreman parts The film started getting drawn out and boring. Then it started to pick up again but most the film felt￼ like the producers should have edited the thing. That's the only thing about this film 🎥 it got extremely boring for a long period. Because of the length and middle of the film (second act) I would wait for streaming",
David1477,An incredible life brought to the cinema! Big George truly is the Greatest. Proves it over and over again.,
Fs111,"exciting , well acted , good charater portrayals .",
Barry,True story..well done.,
David S,Interesting and very inspirational story.,
James B,I thought the movie was done very well and pretty much told the story the way I remembered it. I would recommend anyone see it who was a fan of boxing on the 70s and 80s!!!! A must see.,
Thomas,A true lifes story how The Lord can lift you up when you hit a lie point in life,
Rob,"Wholesome entertainment, and really enjoyed how the movie was done. We loved seeing the full spectrum of George Foreman's life. We would highly recommend!",
Jim D,great movie... especially for teens to young adults!!,
No1 N,"At two-plus hours, the movie seemed rushed; it briefly touched on way too many topics, and important ones like his namesake grill received about a minute of dialogue. The acting was outstanding with a breakout/knockout performance by Shein, with Sonja Sohn, Jasmine Matthews and Khris Davis. The film taught me a lot of things about his life, but only concentrated on two of his many marriages! But it was a one-shot/one-kill for me --- the boxing scenes were ehh --- and I won't be a return visitor! So sorry!",
DuBayonne S,Loved the story of George Foreman's rise to the top and finding God's love and grace along the way.,
Michael,Great film and cast.,
rudy,great job 👍🏾 loved it,
Carol,Every minute was interesting,
Jack M,"excellent compelling film about big George, a far better man than the false glorified Mohammad Ali.",
Joanna M,"Great movie would definitely recommend any one to see. The actors did a great job in this movie 🎬 1,000% great job",
nettamobetta L,Great movie. Loved it. Loved how he became a Christian in a dark time in his life and then won the Heavy weight Boxing Championship!,
MICHAEL P,This is an extremely well acted movie which tells the story of a larger than life sports hero who experiences life's ups and downs and the manner in which he deals with them.,
Abigail,"I loveee movies thats based On a True Story!! Big George Foreman was so good, its not similar to creed 3 but the had fights back in the day when George Foreman went up against Smokey Joe and Muhammad Ali. All of a sudden it hits him, he didnt want to be a fighter he wanted to be a preacher because he loves God!! But it hits him again. He wanna Fight Again because he was willing to win that heavyweight Championship Belt!! This movie played out so good!! 10/10",
Richard L,"Aside from a few risqu topics, the movie captures the transition from youth through adolescence in a tasteful way. Family is so important, and the parents embody their roles perfectly.",
Patty M,A great feel-good movie especially during these unprecedented times! George Foreman's inspirational story is a reminder that determination and perseverance can win over hardships and obstacles in life. I highly recommend watching this movie with your whole family.,
,I don’t know what movie the critics for watching. It definitely was not this one. Excellent story about a remarkable man..,
Angela B,One of Tilmans greatest!! Great movie.,
Danny L,"Really enjoyed this movie. It was clean, not overly brutal for a boxing movie and very inspiring.",
,Great movie!! Loved it! Loved hearing the true story of George finding his Faith. Loved Sullivan Jones who played Ali… he was amazing!,
Zaida,Very touching and inspiring movie!!,
Roger S,"If you are looking for an artistic masterpiece, this is not it. ""Big George Foreman"" is rather two-dimensional in the early going . But it becomes a compelling sports biography that is worth watching in midstream, particularly after the boxer's life crumbles.",
Tiffany Shacole,"Loved it! Never knew all the ups and downs George Foreman faced, but what a heart for God he has. Highly recommend this movie.",
marvin,Excellent movie!!! I enjoyed it very much! The acting was great!,
Tom,"I trained with Foreman as a boxer in 1974 at Solar Gymnasium on W 28th Street, NY and followed him since ... The movie is the true inspiring story of an amazing man - His Will, God's Will, the Will of those around him, random Chance and Fate combined in the journey of his great life. Not Fiction / Real Life. The boxing scenes are accurate as to boxing technique and reproducing each fight which is not true for the majority of boxing movies. THE MOVIE IS GREAT BECAUSE THE MAN'S LIFE IS AN INSPIRATION",
Zachary C,"Watched it specifically due to the ratings of the ""professional critics"" and how they all cringed at the mention of God. Now you all know how we feel when something that doesn't make sense is shoved down your throat. The movie was a tad long but it's hard to shorten the life story of such an accomplished man. I had no idea the struggle George went thru and hold him much higher in my book now",
M. Bosworth,"Fantastic story, well acted and uplifting. Definitely worth seeing!",
10gamma,"This was a well made, well-casted, feel-good movie about one of the greatest power punchers in the boxing game! The lead actor was on point and very believable, and Forrest Whitaker was equally good as the venerable Doc Broadus who discovered and mentored Geroge's career. I remember well being in high school, and staying up late to listen to the round-by-round recap of what was going on. I listened with fret as I heard my hero (Ali) continually being pounded on the ropes, losing round after round,... and then, miraculously, Ali cam alive after the famous ""rope-a-dope"", and knocked Foreman out! This movie effectively captures the spiritual transformation that Foreman makes after the Ali loss, and his triumphant return to capture the Heavyweight Title by knocking out Mike Moorer at the age of 45! This is a true historical treat for true boxing fans, and I give it 4 out of 5 stars!",
JBCentralFL,"Myself, my wife, & my sister all liked the movie very much. I remember George Foreman but I wasn't aware of his very interesting life story. Sufficient amount of action (boxing) and a good true story. I don't recall any bad language - if there was any, it wasn't gratuitous. Just an all around very good movie. Both teens and adults will enjoy.",
Lakita,For me it was the Determination that George Foreman had an also making a life for him an his family no matter what the trials an tribulations he had to go through to get where he wanted to be in life.,
Chanae McCoy,Great movie from beginning to end I want to see it again,

Movie G,Great story. Well developed. Well written. Terrific cast.,
Jesus,Very good inspiring movie about George Foreman. Definitely a must see!,
Ron L,The movie was great. It was inspirational to watch the life of a man so full of hate and self indulgence turn in one moment to become a new man living his life as a example of good to other people. That is our purpose and he discovered it in a moment. I met George at a boxing match and found him to be very kind. I'm glad this movie depicted his journey so well.,
Judy S,There is nothing like a true story come to life on the big screen. Its part of history and well written. Great way to honor an Olympic gold medalist and heavy weight boxer.,
Andrae,great movie showed just enough of each phase of his life to make you understand where his mentality was at each point in time.,
Charles,"Inspirational, and enlightening story. Good clean humor and drama mix. Great job!",
Annie,I like the truth about his rise to become the oldest heavyweight Champion ever live.,
ColoGrayWolf,"Based on the real, but not so well known, story of George Foreman. A redemption story.",
Dale P,All the actors were good and the guy who played Muhammad Ali did a very good job. The critics are too woke to even enjoy Rocky.,
Jerry,"No sex scenes, no filthy language, no vulgarity....a man not afraid to express his faith. great movie!",
Clarence A,Best movie I've seen in a long time. It was great to actually see his story of success and faith in God.,

T3s,Love this movie!! It started out a little slow but it made up for it at the end.,
Vira,I loved the movie!!!,
RJ H,Great inspirational comeback story. If I had listened to the critics I would have missed out on a very engaging movie with a great message about redemption.,
Santo T,"This was a heartwarming story of rags to riches, them from arrogance to humility! Also from humility to Victory!, This is a very inspiring movie, and we love that man, for what he accomplished in real life!",
Logan S,I haven't had a movie experience make me feel so inspired in years,
Victory A,"Seen it…love it! In some parts of the movie, I thought there was someone behind me chopping onions. Motivating and inspiring.",

,Solid move. Moved quickly but overall was solid.,
Brad D,Outstanding what a man went through. To find his true self and worth in this world,
Merian R,Very motivational & inspirational!,
B A,"Big George was a surprise of a movie! I went because my teenage son has recently shown an interest in boxing. I was pleasantly surprised...the movie is more about life, perseverance, pivoting when life throws you curve balls, dreaming, excelling, and believing in yourself. The acting is exceptional and the writing is great. Big George is great storytelling and movie-making at its finest!",
Lynn,Excellent movie!!! Excellent!!!!!!,
Bernetha,True life experiences are educational.,
Kimberly,Great choice for each actor. The story was easy to follow.,
Michele,"The biographical presentation was good beginning with childhood up to achieving Heavy Weight Champion. Casting was excellent, the performance was believable, the script, while long, was good from beginning to end without boredom (2+ hours). While I was mid-adult when George Foreman was at his best and knew about his events at the top of his class, outside of the Muhammed Ali event, I was and am not a devotee of boxing, but the movie was well presented, and I enjoyed learning more about the ""George Foreman"" person. It was 2 hours well spent.",
Roon,Very good and inspiring,
Dani,"The movie was slow, which made it feel long. Nothing really compelling happened. Overall kind of boring .",
Maxine N,"It was definitely better than I expected. All the actors were outstanding, especially those who portrayed Howard Cosell, the sports announcer, and Muhammad Ali. These two actors gave very memorable performances.",
Michelle,Great exploration of the Big Man’s Life as it transitioned into his faith.,
Strawberry,Very Good Movie. You wont be disappointed.,
Shaneesha,Awesome Movie!!! A tear-jerker with a triumphant win!!! Loved it…Truly Amazing!!!,
jjyj y,"Contrary to many reviewer opinions, this is a good movie. The fact that it attempts to combine a George Foreman inner city youngster, whose only ways to deal with his taunts as to his size and the condescending references to his family's poverty (POORMAN vs Foreman) was with his fists, and a later in life calling to Jesus - may not fit the narrative of salvation many might accept as a worthy storyline. This is a story of poverty, desperation, success, failure, redemption and salvation. It is an almost Horatio Alger story of an impoverished young man and his rise to fame and good fortune through hard work, determination and courage. What it is also a story of is his fall from grace and good fortune, a near death experience and loss of everything that he valued most in life. His wife and family, his wealth and his fame. Where many will take exception is in the almost miraculous conversion from a life of anger and ring brutality to one of belief that GOD had a different calling for him and that his reality was one of leading others to the path of salvation that he had so long resisted. The irony of the story being that it was this same spiritual calling that led him back to the lifestyle of boxing that he had fought so hard to escaped from. There is a happy ending. An ending that may reflect the many paths that on may follow in an effort to achieve ones goals. This then is a movie worth seeing and a message worth sharing. Rating: T - P - l - T = The Path Less Traveled",
paul t,It was ok but I was expecting more for the story it telling here is my 1 minute review of it https://youtube.com/shorts/rEI8Udk4hbc?feature=share,
Steph,"I really didn't know much of George's story. Not only is his rise to fame inspirational, but his spiritual growth was a tremendous testimony! Would definitely recommend this inspiring movie!",
Hampton Sands,"Slooooow moving, acting is flat, predictable, silly, fight scenes are amateurish. Don't waste your time or money. Movie promotion is better than the movie itself.",
Angel D,I enjoyed it. It was good to see the changes he went through.,
David,"Historically accurate, but would have liked to see the Ali fight.",
Carol,Wonderful movie! Very interesting and inspirational! Never knew George Foremans story of his journey from poverty and feeling disrespected to greatness in the boxing ring to having a born again experience and becoming a pastor! Then at 45 after 20 years out of the ring going back to regain the world title! Who has what it takes to accomplish that! Its a must see for everyone!,
Lisha T.,I love this movie because I always want to know how amazing people find Christ.,
jeffrey,Like the story. Just not very compelling. Too long.,
Ron L,"This was of the best, most inspirational, and entertaining movie I've seen in a long time. I'm determined to tell everyone I know to see this movie....at least twice!",
Jacqueline,It was an awesome real life story,
John,Was a great movie and I liked the fact it wasn't full of filthy talk. Seemed mostly realistic. I remembered George Foreman's career and I like the fact it was a true story.,
R R,"Easy watch and entertaining movie with some legendary footage. As far as biopics go, it's nowhere near close to that of Freddie Mercury's I or James Brown's but worth a watch.",
PLOT T,"BIG GEORGE FOREMAN is a BIG DUD. This is what happens to biopics when the titular character (in this case George Foreman himself) is alive and exec produces the project. He was too hands-on. This story is a heavy-handed catalogue of Foreman's highlight reel. We don't need a film of highlights when actual highlights are easily available. Sans Bryant Gumbel, this film unfolded like a weak version of an HBO Sports segment, offering fans access into the boxer's training regiment and backstory before the big fight. The problem why this doesn't work is it's redundant. The demo for this biopic is middle-age boxing fans already familiar with Foreman's legacy--who saw the fights live and the read all the splashy news stories. So in that way, this story is rhetorical and curated, in the worst way. I would've preferred this biopic focus on the build-up to either the Ali fight or the Liston fight or his walk with God. Stuffing all of them into one film felt serialized. It's also miscast, which is not newcomer Khris Davis' fault. He delivers the performance they asked for. That significantly contributes to the film's shortcomings. This role might've been better suited for a veteran actor more vocal and commanding who could've guided the performance without the heavy influence of Foreman. Lastly, I expect quality storytelling from Director George Tillman, Jr. He not only directed this subpar film, he also cowrote it. This is a stain on his record.",
judith,"I loved the movie, because it was interesting, serious and funny too.",
Gloria O,I enjoyed it very much! Go see it you’ll like it !,
Rosie,Well done and love this inspirational true story!,
Jared,Great balance of storytelling and inspiration while not being chessy.,
De,I thought it was a great movie and depicted his life of events very well. I see where it could've improved but overall was a good movie.,
Erika,"Excellent movie, I learned a lot about George Forman's life & struggles!",
Ed D,The movie took us behind the scenes to see the trials and tribulations of George Foreman’s life. From his dirt poor beginnings to his resurrection. Good movie.,
Luis F,"It showed lows of lows in George's life, Really accurate, Showed how he became a changed man from not wanting a relationship with God or even thinking he existed to becoming a preacher. Light hearted jokes. Great movie overall!!!",
Loretta M,Excellent. Great story and phenomenal accomplishments. Never knew a lot about his history.,
Bill H,"Well done movie telling the story of Foreman’s life journey in light of changing driving motifs. The critics that complain about the transition between a boxing movie to a religious film miss the point of Foreman’s story. The movie seemed true to his own account that I heard from him years ago. Whether or not you are predisposed to find it a compelling or satisfying account, all of it, including his boxing journey was backstory to his testimony because that faithful to his own experience of his story.",
Gil T,"When you bare witness to true life events, it brings life to the film like Big George Fornan, the story of a great man in so many ways. First and foremost, an honorable, true man of God and also a great representation of his sportsmanship. Five star ratings for me!",
Richard,I liked that it was a heartfelt movie with meaning.,
Kellie R,"Such a great movie! Highly recommend. It was funny, emotional, and heart warming.",
harrison,"It was a very sanitized and highlight version of foreman’s career and off screen life, but doesn’t go deep enough on his early struggles. It just speeds through the first half and hitting highlights, but doesn’t go under the surface. A two time champion deserved more.",
Charlie B,It was wonderful and true story!!,
Wayne,Didn't really like the way it ended,
Sam A,"Good movie. Exceptional acting, and the pacing was much better than I expected it to be (so many biopics tend to drag at some point in the runtime). The boxing scenes are fairly accurate to the fights they depict, and the movie shows us Foreman's vices as well as virtues (albeit in a somewhat sanitized, family-friendly format). As a boxing fan, I would have loved an R-rated version of Foreman's life with a 3.5 hour runtime, but the filmmakers chose to make a movie that was accessible for kids and adults alike. That's understandable, and for a family-friendly boxing movie, I don't know how it could have been better.",
Big George Foreman,The movie was great from beginning to end.,
Marcia T,"Such an exciting, inspirational movie. I was on the edge of my seat! This is a must-see movie for everyone young and old. Its more than boxing, its about life!",
jackie78,Extremely well acted interesting story!,
hb,"Engaging story. Anyone can achieve the impossible with the almighty by your side. Even though you cant see him working, you know he always has everything under control...FAITH",
Sharon,I love that it was faith based and had no profanity and sex scenes.,
Justin H,"It was better than I expected - did surprising justice in some parts and slipped up in or sped through others, but that's par when covering so many decades of boxing history. The average movie critic probably doesn't know much about boxing and the movie talks a lot about Jesus, so feel free to disregard the critic score on this one.",
Marshell,Beautifully written and produced!,
umar I,"Great movie, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is into combat sports. Getting to know more about the life of the old legend was great and some of his achievements were unbelievable. Idk why the critics gave him a low rating but personally I would highly recommend it. Even my gf liked the movie",
Deborah Tejada,Really well made entertaining uplifting.,
thomas O,"Remembering the events, movie was very entertaining. Well acted.",
Clifford G,Nothing less than Inspirational. A must see.,
Patrick Byers,Undeniably the best sports movie I have ever seen .,
Deborah D,"It was a fantastic movie, with a real feel good factor - there is much more to George Foreman than I knew.",
Stephen D,"Conventional but highly polished, engaging and sincere. Great performance from all the cast.",
Bruce,"5 star inspiring, motivational, Christian, well produced movie. I'm going to go see it again",
George,Loved it and would see it again,
Alysha S,"The story is astonishing. I can't believe this is basically how it happened in real life. Also, acting is splendid among a handful of actors. I am surprised this film wasn't made earlier, because George Foreman's story is so amazing, the film could have even been made in at least a couple of different ways as well and been equally good.",
Gayle M,Great movie!!! Inspiring!!!,
Beverly H,Great Movie and written very very well. I am from Houston while he was fighting . Knew the area brought back memories,
Dale H,Excellent movie. Must see.,
Cassandra P,It was a good depiction of the good and bad,
Chase T,"Man, great movie! I'm going back to the theater again to see it a second time. My college friends need to see this to understand how to get over obstacles and challenges we face in our everyday lives. This movie delivers something for the whole family. It's definitely a must-see movie again and again.",
Taylor M,"It has the heart and passion to be good, but it completely misses the mark when the film is outside the ring. Foreman as a fighter is undisputed in boxing, but his faith is richer than this film promotes. Good enough to kill some time on the weekend, but this is not a film of the ""Creed"" level.",
SHEILA,"Wholesome, no profanity, Clean and Inspirational",
Gerald C,I really enjoyed the movie and it was inspirational. The first half was definitely better than the second half which at times felt a bit slow and the ending which truthfully felt a little rushed. If you are a fan of boxing and have a faith in God you will especially enjoy it. Don’t expect an Oscar worthy movie but it will be enjoyable and his story is certainly an inspirational one. I recommend it.,
William,"Outstanding movie about commitment, determination, faith and love. George Forman was truly one of a kind! Great story, acting and direction!",
Randy W,"Even though you know the outcome if you are a fan of boxing, it was a great movie learning about his life a how it brought him to being the champ!",
,Enjoyed every minute of it! Amazing actors and timeline of the great George Foreman.,
Deke P,"GREAT man & great movie. Should be seen by all. Watching it, I could not help but anticipate how the majority of 'professional Reviewers"" (i.e. RT types) would disrespect this movie as they do almost all of what they deride as 'faith based'. And I was not wrong, seeing the low pro ratings and snarky comments here on RT. This was great casting, great acting, and a generally great story of George's life. Giving it max 5 RT stars. Saw it opening Friday, 4.29.2023, 'lerton AMC.",
Brian S,The story of this TWO-TIME Champion was moving inspiring and motivating. Relatable in it's narrative and defining in its execution. Thanks to Big George for sharing the point that God is at the center whether we acknowledge the fact or not.,
1jwbirmingham,This story is truly a wonderful story of transformation and redemption! To win the heavyweight title at the age of 45 is truly a miracle. This movie will Bless you! See it! 5 Star rating!,
Bernadine,"As a Boxing fan and a fan of George Foreman, I knew I would like the movie. But , I was wowed! The storyline and the acting were awesome! 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽",
katherine f,great movie for anyone who believes in miracles. or at least wants too.,
Tim S,"Very moving, very well made. I wished they would have spent more time developing his conversion.",
Jon F,What a life! This boxing film is different from others. I tried telling someone about George Foreman after watching this film and couldn't do it without crying.,
Shannon M,Inspiring movie. Truly touching.,
Janet,This was a wonderful movie. A story of bad times and good times of struggles and successes. Very fulfilling.,
JG,loved it. I used to always say that someone should make a movie about him. and it happened. you dont have to be into the sport of boxing to appreciate this..,
Dee J,"Big George Foreman was EXCELLENT!!! I throughly enjoyed it, and left the theater feeling good inside!!",
Samuel M,We absolutely loved it. I have always have been a Foreman fan. Great acting in which contributed to a fantastic movie. I was surprised the boxing scenes did not dominate the film. My compliments to George.,
Daniel Guerrero,This was a phenomenal movie. Praise Jesus,
Evelyn,Good movie without bad words!!,
Charlie F,Quite a moving and inspiring story. Taught me some facts I wasn't aware of. Think I'll see the movie again next week.,
Ted F,Awrsome. And unlike Rocky this was true. What a comeback story. I’ll pay for all my kids to go. This was greeeaaat!!,
Caroline L,"I am so inspired by this story. George Foreman had some big ups and downs in life and kept his head and heart in the right place in the end. I love boxing movies, and athlete movies, and this did not disappoint. Forest Whitaker is always fantastic, the whole cast was very good.",
Katherine H,Very exciting and true to the power of emotions and the power of God.,
Charity A,"if you have insomnia, you'll sleep well through this movie. this is a total disservice to george foreman's legacy. thankfully the grill still works great.",
Bill G.,"Original,-heart warming, exciting, true, real deal-like Cinderella Man but different time.",
Carl,I liked the whole movie. I thought it had so many fundamental items to build from it encouraged you to believe.,
Michael,I thought it showed his faith and perseverance!! Showed that he had the faith in him all the time. Just had to get it out!!,
Valerie,"From Mr Foreman's brave journey, to the actors selection, to the filming - this movie is wonderful all around!!",
Ricksta 6,"The movie celebrates a life worth celebrating. It is the truncated story of George Foreman, the mean, moody and angry world boxing champion of the early 1970s who seemed, at the time, unbeatable. He was bigger, stronger, and punched harder, than anyone else and so made short shrift of all his opponents on his march to the World Title, which he won in devastating style against the then world champion Joe Frazier. What follows was interesting to say the least and George's life took many turns. For those who know the story, you will recognise the many vignettes the movie includes of George's life. The boxing action is very realistic, and is true to original events, but this is more than just a boxing movie as it is about, fulfilment, inspiration, family, dreams and reality. There's enough there for everyone and you will feel you have experienced something worthwhile and uplifting and it is definitely worth a watch.",
MIchael O,"Great fight scenes, and good characterizations of George and his contemporaries. Forrest Whittaker is marvelous! George’s choices as a man of faith may not make sense to those who do not believe, but isn’t that a sign of his sincerity? Recommended.",
,One of the best boxing movies ever.,
kenneth b,"Since George is a part of my generation, this was a great movie and revealed some details we didn't know about. Some the transitions were a little cationic, the overall movie was enjoyable. This could have been a great made for tv movie but didn't mind paying to see.",
Consuella,It was a good movie. It seemed like it was longer than 2 hours.,
David S,"Big George Forman is a powerful, moving, and inspiring story. The film made me root for the Underdog! Must-See!",
Kimberly J,"Well Done, great to learn history of a local legend.",
Pknow72,Very informative and revealing about a true champ!! Enjoyed it very much.,
Lowry P,Outstanding movie! All the events in the movie were very real for me. They happened throughout my life in real time. It was like a history lesson reviewed. Amazing acting and story. A must see.,
Grant,The movie was wonderful!! Had no idea his incredible story. Everyone should see this movie,
Jeff,Marvelous inspiring movie! What a beautiful story of the overcoming power of Jesus Christ. The characters looked so much like their real counterparts. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie!! This movie would be worth seeing again!,
Don H,This is part of boxing history. Best movie EVER!!!!,
Linda,You needed to explain more about how he was touched by Jesus while he was dead!!!!,
George P,Great inspiring movie about the best boxer of all time in my opinion. A must see.,
Donnita A,It was an AWESOME movie! Prayer still works y'all!!!!,
Let's Get Vegasy W,First off I'm a Big George Foreman fan. I was 20 when he started his comeback and went to a few matches and watched all his fights on the comeback. Do I know the story show it played out all those years ago. Fast forward to today I went to the first showing in Las Vegas at the Palms Hotel. Only 3 other people were at the 4pm showing. The movie played like a a TV movie of the week that they used to have back in day. Parts were rushed parts went on too long. The actor playing Big George was well cast. The actor playing Howard Cosell did not do Howard justice. The fight scenes were lackluster and didn't capture the moment. Overall about a C+ Rating. I would much rather see a boxing documentary on Foreman then this movie. If you do see this movie then watch a boxing Doc on Foreman. They have a few just on his fight with Ali. Hearing the real George speak and talk about his comeback is so much better then this movie.,
Ron,Really well done and portrayed Foreman in a realistic light.,
Esme B,Somehow incredibly rushed yet horribly dull at the same time…,
George Foreman,Liked how Foreman had to be humbled by God before God put him back on top.,
Freedom S,Really inspiring story and a walkthrough of how George went to the Olympics to his fight with Ali and Jimmy young to his spiritual fight opening a youth club and comeback to the championship again. 👍,
Demara H,"Great storyline, wonderful acting, great music. Fantastic!",
samuel,good film which it cover more on his faith,
GW,Good casting. Great story of an amazing man.,
Jimmy Lonon,a true inspirational story of redemption.,
Gregg A,"I lived through the Comeback. It was Epic. George deserved this movie, and I enjoyed every moment of it. Fan of Big George, should not miss",
Jeffrey K,Very entertaining! Better than expected! Never a dull moment.,
Patrick C,"Yes, just like Big George himself, the title reflects the larger-than-life man and his story. A biopic about the former 2-time heavyweight champion of the world and his call to ministry later in life. Khris Davis stars as George and does a wonderful job embodying him. He has the size and physical appearance but also his gentleness as well. Forest Whitaker is the only name most audiences will be firmly with to lend some respectability to the project. Whitaker plays Doc Broadus, a former superior of his in the job corps who is the one who introduces George to the sport, before being his trainer as well. Like any biopic, this film hits the highs and lows, from his fight against Muhammad Ali (Sullivan Jones) to Michael Moorer (Charles Brewer Jr.) on his comeback bid. However, the film is just as much about George's faith as it is about his boxing as he walked away from the ring while still in his prime in order to minister. It's a well-done, heartfelt, and inspirational film that in today's oversensitive and hyper-politicized climate, we could use more of.",
Leslie,Fantastic life story,
Anthony,amazing story awesome testimony,
Sandra,It was a very exciting movie. Didn't know that he was that poor at first and heavy. Glad he got the heavy weight championship before he retired.,
Chris C,Really good movie. It did seem like they cut a few things out here and there but it would've been a five hour movie with all the stuff. George has accomplished.,
Damon,I learned a great deal about George Forman than I did before I saw the movie. Good story.,
StephenPaul C,The greatest 02 hours: and 08 minutes based on George Foreman's life and career!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
