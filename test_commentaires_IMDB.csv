rahulharish-21865,"The movie has high production value and is better than 99% of the Bollywood movies out there. Amazing screenplay, so not a dull moment. The true story of how a girl in Kerala, pursuing a Masters degree away from home, is brainwashed by the radical community there, to turn against her family and her faith. She and other students are manipulated by a radical roommate and some male friends into sleazy relationships in the name of 'love'. Forced conversion follows with the tacit support of the community, which tears apart the homes of all 3 girls. They become prisoners of an age old desert cult, they barely understand and have no connection with. Cheated and then shipped off as slaves and baby factories to Syria and Afghanistan, will they reunite with their families? Watch to find out.",,5 May 2023,10/10
rohonnag,"Movies can entertain, they can invoke new ideas and sometimes they can bring about change. Change of thought process, change of perspective etc. This is a movie that changes your perception of the world we live in, especially if you don't know what sort of things are happening around us hidden in plain sight.

This is a movie which is difficult to watch. Not because it is not well made, but because it shows the stark-naked truth in such a simple and devastating manner. Things that happen to the women in this film which is based on real life incidents are not for the weak of stomach. But it's the reality we live in and most would find it convenient to ignore the truth rather than confront it.

As a film, the cinematography is good, the camera work is organic and not overly dramatic. There are some dramatic shots, but those are needed to set the tone of the film. The look and feel of the film seem more real than fictional. This movie feels very authentic in its tonality and stands apart from typical Bollywood films like Kabul Express, Fanaa or Kurbaan.

The narrative of the film is nonlinear. It follows roughly three different timelines of the same person. First one of her being in college, another of her in Afghanistan and the last one of her incarcerated at an UN detention camp. The scenes flow mostly seamlessly from one timeline to the other. Sometimes the shift in tonality from a happy and positive interaction in the past to a rather bleak and grim present is done intentionally to jar the audience and shake them from their slumber (figuratively speaking) of believing all is right in the world just because they can't see such things happening in front of them.

All the songs in the film are either used in montage scenes or in the background. There is no waste of time entertainment dance numbers or anything overtly filmi when it comes to the music. The background score is used sparingly but is effective.

Overall: As a film, this is a very tragic subject matter. It's hard to make it through the movie without some sort of emotional reaction, be it sadness, depression or sheer anger. The movie is meant to evoke such reactions. That's what showing the truth as plainly as possible does to the masses. So be warned, this is a film that is hard hitting and not a fun time pass sort of watch. Don't go in with a bunch of friends expecting to have a good time.

Go see it with friends and family to open their eyes on what is going on and what might happen to someone they know and love if we as a society don't hold the people doing such inhuman acts accountable for their actions. This is a film that every Indian needs to see. Its an absolute must watch.

Rating: 7.5/10.

Conclusion: There are no negatives as such in the film, but maybe due to censor board, scenes that are showing the conversion to radical thought process did feel a bit truncated. Some moments of the film could have lingered a tad bit more to hammer the point home. But those are minor gripes in an otherwise well-made film about a very tragic and intense subject matter.",,5 May 2023,8/10
nkj-vsp,Many hidden facts which was hidden from people and society. We always think that somethings is going upfront but behind there are many things took place to our own faiths. Many real and eye opening truth which was not revealed hats off to director and actor who worked on and made this movie a masterpiece with blockbuster. I really keep this movie to show to my kids now they are too small but once they get maturity i will show them every year so that they don't forget and always learn.

munmoonghosh-48734,"This movie shows how women are recruited to be sent to IS. The whole journey is way too disturbing! But young girls must watch this movie so that they dont believe everything in the name of love.

Adah Sharma nailed the show!!! The background music could have been better though. The other supporting characters were bringing the best in Adah Sharma.

If you are looking for a masala movie then it is not your cup of tea. It is based on a very sensitive topic. It will make you uncomfortable.

The people in India act too sophisticated to not discuss what all is happening in the name of religion. We must make ourselves comfortable and stop fearing that we are judged if we speak the truth about the conversion games.",,6 May 2023,10/10

What you love is the imotion but if i go with film specific, The movie should be in normal language like more malyalam, but ok, Then second issue is I think very high cuts or Editing issue i don't know but i think some flaws in that, Acting is good, All actors have picked up their character Really well.

Good cinematography, Some points are over the top, Screenplay is very well paced, Good worth of money, Yes the target to particular community is evident, but many things are facts, we can't avoid them, I think in short,

Go have a watch 18+, Good , But hardcore.",,5 May 2023,9/10

limitedwatersupplied,"'The Kerala Story' narrates the tales of three young girls from various regions of Kerala, with the primary focus on the story of Shalini, who is abducted and subsequently converted to Islam. Shalini is then radicalized. And compelled to join ISIS as a terrorist.

'The Kerala Story' is centered around the alleged radicalization and conversion of young Hindu women to Islam in Kerala, after which they are forced to join ISIS. The film states that it's a true story of three young girls from different parts of Kerala.

Riveting story telling method combined with great performances, tight screenplay and crisp editing made it a master piece. What's disturbing is that it's all happened really in the country.

An eye opener for every girls and their families. Must watch.",,5 May 2023,10/10
anchalawasthi-37029,"What fantastic acting by Adah Sharma, and the cast was spot on. Very intriguing story, really heart wrenching story, and I could believe it because I had been listening to so called religious people on television word by word, thus all the manipulations presented in this movie are 100 percent correct. I wish that after witnessing this movie, justice would be served, or that at the very least, an investigation would be launched.

A must-see film. The filmmakers of this film performed an excellent job, and I wish them all the success and recognition they deserve.

tejasdhanuka,"MUST WATCH! 10/10.

I am NOT any ideology or party/AGENDA supporter, but I must say this is one of the best movies I have seen in recent times. It shows a very detailed situation of terrorism and it's strategic planning not only in war but in the terms of soft war and brainwashing people. Irrespective of the controversy whether the cases are 32000 or 3, one must understand that even if the case is only ONE still this is what the terrorist have agenda.

Besides the message I must say the acting is done very well by the characters. You will not be bored in the entire duration of the movie. Whether or not you think of this as agenda or truth do watch for the actors and storyline.",,6 May 2023,10/10
vamshi_vemula,"The movie industry is constantly evolving and has the power to influence the way people think and act. Some movies are made solely for entertainment purposes while others have a more profound meaning and leave a lasting impact on their audience. It takes a great deal of courage and conviction to produce a movie that is based on true events and deals with sensitive topics. Kudos to the movie makers for taking up this challenge and creating a film that sheds light on a real-life incident.

Making a movie that is based on true events is no small feat. The filmmakers have to ensure that the facts are accurate and that they do justice to the story. At the same time, they have to be mindful of the emotions of the people involved and the impact that the movie might have on them.

avegwwe,"A DEF YES YES movie for Every Indian irrespective of religion. This is the harsh reality one must accept, the way this movie has articulated the story, concepts is way beyond acknowledgement. We need to discuss these topics openly in society and cinema is a prominent stage for that, I am glad that there are open discussions and even cinema is accepting and acknowledging this.

Till now only few actors, directors are showing courage to direct and act such movies we need to give at par contribution to their courage and zeal so atleast we will bring more acknowledgement regarding these topics in society.

EVERYONE MUST WATCH IT.",,6 May 2023,10/10

I'm sure this movie will help in speeding awareness among the youths and also to their parents.

This is not only a problem of a religion, country also been getting effected.

Great screenplay, great direction.

Only fact was twisted is numbers, it's not 32, 000. But the other facts are genuine ones and still happening in our society. More power to the makers.

It need a lot of courage to make a movie like this.

I wish there are more movies to be releases having such social issues and make people aware of these issues.

sandeepsavs,"Beautifully written movie, you may feel in some parts it's too raw but then it is required so that people are forced to think. Movie is not against any religion. It is again propaganda which makes only one religion better than others. Propoganda which casually mocks and makes fun of Hindu's. Also movie shows we are not teaching our kids about our religion, culture and roots and therefore they are not aligning with us instead they aling with others. Hindu girl is trapped easily as she lacked basic knowledge of her own religion but then Catholic was also trapped and if then don't succeed they blackmail and rape!

mannuforall,"The Kerala Story 2023 film is a good movie and enlightens a big horrible issue. The director did a great job and the producers are brave enough to bring this story in public.

The acting was fine enough to entertain and give you a feel of the story and the matter. The Kerala Story movie also covers a lot of imp points around the main issue and builds a solid storyline. Well written dialogue and they leave impact.

The locations look real like we have seen in various real videos of these terrorists areas and makeup is also very impressive and look real.

Fella_shibby,"Terrible screenplay, wooden acting, abysmal direction, lousy editing n appalling cinematography.

There is absolutely no redeeming quality about this trash.

This movie is a stain upon the name of art, the script is a poorly cluttered and illogical joke masking the director's fantasies, the dialog will have you tear out your eardrums with your fingernails, and the acting is so atrocious you will feel as if the movie has violated you.

Some films are so bad, they're good aka fun.

But few films are so terribel you actually feel physical pain while viewing them. So bad are these damned few that you don't experience them or watch them: you ""endure"" them. This is the mother of all such films!",,8 May 2023,1/10
parthdelk,"This movie is a masterpiece and very bold step to speak about truth. There is a dialogue when daughter blames parents why they did not teach proper lesson of Indian culture and religion during their childhood, instead of that they tought communist ideologies which is not relevant in Indian culture. That's the main message of this movie. Direction, screenplay, cinematography is absolutely fine. Every Indian parents should show this movie to their daughters and children. This film is about what not to do. Hope now and onwards people will be more aware about terrorism traps and give proper lesson to their children. Must watch moview.",,8 May 2023,10/10

Now to the movie Movie is good Will push you emotionally to the edge Acting is good by all the characters Direction could be a little more realistic if it's based on true events without softening the blows Recommend to watch at least once Will leave a impression on you after you exit the hall Stay safe be aware and spread awareness.",,5 May 2023,10/10
ashwinnagar,"The movie Kerala Story is a poignant and thought-provoking portrayal of the dangers and devastation wrought by ISIS terror, particularly in the Indian state of Kerala, which has a large Muslim population. The film sheds light on how ISIS recruits non-Muslim women from Kerala through deceitful means, and then puts them in harm's way on the battlefield, making their lives a living hell. It is a powerful wake-up call for the world to confront the evil designs of this terrorist organization.

Through its gripping narrative and powerful visuals, the movie exposes the insidious tactics used by ISIS to lure young non-Muslim girls, convert them to Islam, and then use them for their own nefarious purposes. The film highlights the stark reality of the situation and makes us aware of the urgent need to act against such heinous acts.

Overall, Kerala Story is a must-watch movie that provides a stark reminder of the dangers posed by terrorism and the need for vigilance against it. It is a powerful call to action for people all over the world to stand up against terrorism and fight for the protection of innocent lives.",,5 May 2023,10/10
imajinkyajadhav,"Magnificent writing and direction to showcase the reality. Amazing efforts by the entire production. Hard-hitting, reaching audience. The story is similar to the Swedish Web Series Caliphate, and relies on the same background. No wonder this isn't just in India but also in Europe and elsewhere. To that part, the truth has been brought out, and really well presented by the cast. Definitely the best movie I've seen in the recent and among the best movies about modern terrorism and young people's Islamic radicalization from any country, India to be specific. Well-acted, well-paced, nuanced, entirely believable.",,6 May 2023,10/10
kaushaltheguru,"Not for a faint heart, this story makes you squirm. This is story of the infamous ISIS brides and how how deep rooted the network in the ISIS is.

The story is said from a perspective of a victim and we see her story and get connect with her.

We see how she is slowly and steadily gripped in the tentacles of isis.

Some people have not even watched the movie and calling it against a religion, but there is nothing about any religion in the movie this movie is all about how ISIS Operates and their modus oprandi around the world.

And at the end this is a thrilling movie to watch and experience the horrors of terrorism from eyes of the protagonist.",,6 May 2023,10/10

This is a must watch film.

As per story, It is well written and synchronised with the events. Dialogues are impactful and grabs attention significantly.

Direction is fabulous and screenplay is tight, director has left no space where you can feel boredom.

Coming to the performance of actors this feels like the best performance of Adah Sharma. Her expression for the emotional scenes are so raw and natural. Other actresses likes Yogita, Siddhi and Sonia has also done justice to their characters.

So this is a film that everyone must watch at least once.",,5 May 2023,10/10

As an audience we feel like we've got a gem in the movie industry and may you get so many wonderful roles in future also.

I thank and at the same time congratulate the makers of this masterpiece on bringing this up. This movie made me stand still. The opening of the movie and the backdrop, the background is in complete sync.

It presents an uncomfortable truth, which has been denied and neglected till date. As an Indian citizen, this is a must watch for all of us.

Tremendously well presented!

vtmathewm,"I watched the movie after seeing positive reviews.

Sadly disappointed. As a Keralite it was pushing the limits of my intelligence and sense to watch the pathetic screenplay. Nursing students molested in a Mall in full public view, in Kerala?? No one reacts, not even mobile phone and online media warriors? Come on.

Nursing students seen taking pills given to them just as if it was the most normal thing to do. Even kids would be wary. Whoever wrote the screenplay needs to get a reality check.

A mother whose daughter is missing for long, gets a surprise call from her later from Afghanistan, and she has for her mushy dialogues, like how does it feel to be a mother.

I saw the Hindi version, for some inexplicable reason all actors speak Hindi with a Malayalam accent and Malyalam with a Hindi accent. You can't be both.

At the end, they say they have filed an RTI to verify their own claims of numbers. It's your own claim! You have to provide proof.

avegwwe,"A DEF YES YES movie for Every Indian irrespective of religion. This is the harsh reality one must accept, the way this movie has articulated the story, concepts is way beyond acknowledgement. We need to discuss these topics openly in society and cinema is a prominent stage for that, I am glad that there are open discussions and even cinema is accepting and acknowledging this.

Till now only few actors, directors are showing courage to direct and act such movies we need to give at par contribution to their courage and zeal so atleast we will bring more acknowledgement regarding these topics in society.

EVERYONE MUST WATCH IT.",,6 May 2023,10/10
zahirpt,"Good movie. This problem still present in Kerala and some part Karnataka.

I'm sure this movie will help in speeding awareness among the youths and also to their parents.

This is not only a problem of a religion, country also been getting effected.

Great screenplay, great direction.

Only fact was twisted is numbers, it's not 32, 000. But the other facts are genuine ones and still happening in our society. More power to the makers.

It need a lot of courage to make a movie like this.

I wish there are more movies to be releases having such social issues and make people aware of these issues.

Well done team.",,6 May 2023,10/10
sandeepsavs,"Beautifully written movie, you may feel in some parts it's too raw but then it is required so that people are forced to think. Movie is not against any religion. It is again propaganda which makes only one religion better than others. Propoganda which casually mocks and makes fun of Hindu's. Also movie shows we are not teaching our kids about our religion, culture and roots and therefore they are not aligning with us instead they aling with others. Hindu girl is trapped easily as she lacked basic knowledge of her own religion but then Catholic was also trapped and if then don't succeed they blackmail and rape! Really hard hitting!",,6 May 2023,10/10

This movie is a stain upon the name of art, the script is a poorly cluttered and illogical joke masking the director's fantasies, the dialog will have you tear out your eardrums with your fingernails, and the acting is so atrocious you will feel as if the movie has violated you.

Some films are so bad, they're good aka fun.

Now to the movie Movie is good Will push you emotionally to the edge Acting is good by all the characters Direction could be a little more realistic if it's based on true events without softening the blows Recommend to watch at least once Will leave a impression on you after you exit the hall Stay safe be aware and spread awareness.",,5 May 2023,10/10
ashwinnagar,"The movie Kerala Story is a poignant and thought-provoking portrayal of the dangers and devastation wrought by ISIS terror, particularly in the Indian state of Kerala, which has a large Muslim population. The film sheds light on how ISIS recruits non-Muslim women from Kerala through deceitful means, and then puts them in harm's way on the battlefield, making their lives a living hell. It is a powerful wake-up call for the world to confront the evil designs of this terrorist organization.

Through its gripping narrative and powerful visuals, the movie exposes the insidious tactics used by ISIS to lure young non-Muslim girls, convert them to Islam, and then use them for their own nefarious purposes. The film highlights the stark reality of the situation and makes us aware of the urgent need to act against such heinous acts.

Overall, Kerala Story is a must-watch movie that provides a stark reminder of the dangers posed by terrorism and the need for vigilance against it. It is a powerful call to action for people all over the world to stand up against terrorism and fight for the protection of innocent lives.",,5 May 2023,10/10

Some people have not even watched the movie and calling it against a religion, but there is nothing about any religion in the movie this movie is all about how ISIS Operates and their modus oprandi around the world.

vtmathewm,"I watched the movie after seeing positive reviews.

Sadly disappointed. As a Keralite it was pushing the limits of my intelligence and sense to watch the pathetic screenplay. Nursing students molested in a Mall in full public view, in Kerala?? No one reacts, not even mobile phone and online media warriors? Come on.

Nursing students seen taking pills given to them just as if it was the most normal thing to do. Even kids would be wary. Whoever wrote the screenplay needs to get a reality check.

A mother whose daughter is missing for long, gets a surprise call from her later from Afghanistan, and she has for her mushy dialogues, like how does it feel to be a mother.

I saw the Hindi version, for some inexplicable reason all actors speak Hindi with a Malayalam accent and Malyalam with a Hindi accent. You can't be both.

At the end, they say they have filed an RTI to verify their own claims of numbers. It's your own claim! You have to provide proof.

bivuinc,"'The Kerala Story' begins in the interrogation room where Shalini (Adah Sharma) is revealing details of her horrific and tragic past and the reason why she is in a situation of crisis. Her backstory revolves around four college students who have enrolled in a Nursing School in Kasargauda, Kerala. The story is narrated from the perspective of Shalini, who shares a deep bond with her roommates Gitanjali (Siddhi Idnani), Nimah (Yogita Bihani), and Asifa (Sonia Balani). Unbeknownst to others, Asifa has a secret agenda to expose and convert her roommates to Islam. With the assistance of her male associates from outside, she ensures that the girls are radicalized and indoctrinated into the religion using hallucinogenic drugs. After Shalini becomes pregnant, she is compelled to marry someone other than the man who impregnated her, and then embarks on a long journey to Syria via Pakistan and Afghanistan.

At certain points, the film feels more like a tutorial of radicalization than entertainment for the audience. It also goes to extremes to make its point, and that could be quite unsettling for audiences belonging to various communities in our country. After watching 'The Kerala Story,' you may be left with several questions about the current state of the country.

For me, it's Just a hype created by people.

I don't Care about what others say. The movie is just completely pointless. It feels unnatural.

Its not worth the hype for which people are going Crazy.

The movie claims to be inspired by real-life events, but it seems to be entirely baseless and lacks any real substance. The plot is all over the place, and it's difficult to understand what is happening. The characters are poorly developed, and their motivations are unclear. The dialogues are unconvincing.

Its only the Acting of the Talented Actors which doesn't feel unnatural and feels real.

Despite the movie's claims to be inspired by real-life events, there is no sense of realism or authenticity. The story seems to be fabricated to attract audiences, and the title seems to be a mere marketing ploy. The movie fails to deliver any real emotional impact or make a meaningful statement.

Adah Sharma was able to bring out the emotions and feelings of the audience as it was required from her as an actor. From the South Indian accent to some clap-worthy dialogues, Adah was a treat to watch on the big screen. Sudipto Sen majorly focused on three 'true stories', he did bring out his creative work by not just showing the dark elements but also giving refreshments to his audience by showing the beautiful views of Kerala, a South Indian household, and some college moments. Not only he focused on the plight of the three women but also on the pain that was inflicted on the families. Each woman's story was different from the other but yet connected by the same thread - Terrorism.

Anonymous_ly,"The movie stays to the point for the entire length, the effort to make it in such a way that a typical Indian woman can connect to her daily life, is evident. The parts that appear exaggeratingly violent are unfortunately, factually correct.

The only curse of the movie is that the people have a very rigid perception about the movie, the audience is highly polarized, those who'll watch will support & those who won't will oppose, in all this, the efforts to address an immediate need for a mass level awareness about mainstream beliefs of world's fastest growing religion, are compromised.

One area where it succeeds fully, is in conveying the sorrow of the women portrayed.

Several areas of improvement could be pointed out in terms of subtlety of story & script writing, but they would make the movie irrelevant for the Indian masses.

arifnizamcynic,"Professedly based on ""many true stories"", The Kerala Story, directed by Sudipto Sen, isn't really interested in the truth as a whole. Taking the cases of a handful of missing girls, it spins a yarn that would have us believe that Kerala has contributed thousands of foot soldiers to ISIS over the years. Needless to say, that claim isn't backed up with either evidence or genuine concern.

No more than a lengthy WhatsApp forward in the guise of a movie, The Kerala Story would have been deemed a passable vehicle for a half-baked conspiracy theory had the film not been as laughably inept, both in terms of its making and its tonalities. It cannot by any stretch of the imagination be accused of being a balanced investigation.

A stray shot late in the film is enough to sum up what is wrong with The Kerala Story apart from its lopsided, selective and alarmist theorising about the state's global terror links. On a beach stands a dried-up tree that looks like a prop put there for no particular reason.",,5 May 2023,1/10

You dont feel you are watching the movie but a documentary.

Immense research has gone into the movie of 7 years. Director Sudipto Sen has spoken how he visited Kerala several times in past 7yrs to reseach on the subject and that research shows in the film.

itprowebsite,"""Keral Story"" is a gripping and thought-provoking film that explores the harsh realities faced by young girls in India who are coerced into converting to Islam and the subsequent struggles they face in adapting to their new way of life. Directed by the talented Naveen John, the film takes an unflinching look at the lives of these girls, and the obstacles they must overcome to find a sense of belonging in a society that has turned its back on them.

The film centers around the story of a young Hindu girl named Meenakshi (played by the talented Anjali Nair), who is forced to convert to Islam by her husband after their marriage. Her journey is one that is filled with heartbreak and struggle, as she tries to navigate the complex and often hostile world of her new religion.

One of the strengths of ""Keral Story"" is the way in which it portrays the complex and nuanced nature of religious conversion. The film does not take a simplistic approach to this subject, but rather explores the different motivations and factors that can lead someone to convert. In the case of Meenakshi, her conversion is motivated by love for her husband, but also by a desire to escape the poverty and hardship of her old life.

The film also does an excellent job of showing the ways in which conversion can be used as a tool of control and manipulation by those in power. Meenakshi's husband is portrayed as a domineering figure who uses religion as a means of exerting control over her, and it is clear that his motivations are not purely spiritual. This aspect of the film is particularly relevant in the context of contemporary India, where there has been a rise in incidents of forced conversion.

The performances in ""Keral Story"" are uniformly excellent, with Anjali Nair delivering a powerful and nuanced portrayal of Meenakshi. Her journey from a naive and vulnerable young girl to a strong and independent woman is both moving and inspiring, and Nair is able to convey a wide range of emotions with subtlety and skill.

The supporting cast is also impressive, with notable performances from Sudhi Koppa as Meenakshi's husband, and Surabhi Lakshmi as her friend and confidante. The chemistry between the actors feels natural and authentic, and the relationships between the characters are one of the film's strongest aspects.

One of the most striking elements of ""Keral Story"" is its visual style. The film is shot in a naturalistic and understated manner, with a focus on capturing the everyday details of life in rural India. The use of light and shadow is particularly effective, and the cinematography is able to convey a sense of the harsh beauty of the Indian landscape.

The film's soundtrack is also noteworthy, with a haunting and evocative score that complements the visuals perfectly. The use of traditional Indian instruments, such as the sitar and tabla, gives the film an authentic and immersive feel, and the music is able to convey the complex emotions of the characters with great subtlety and nuance.

Overall, ""Keral Story"" is a powerful and emotionally resonant film that deals with important issues in a sensitive and nuanced manner. The film's exploration of the complexities of religious conversion, and the ways in which it can be used as a tool of control, is particularly relevant in the context of contemporary India. The performances are uniformly excellent, and the visual and musical elements of the film are both impressive and effective. Director Naveen John has crafted a film that is both thought-provoking and moving, and ""Keral Story"" is a must-see for anyone interested in exploring the complexities of religion, gender, and power.",,5 May 2023,10/10

This movie was an eye opener, later when I researched on internet I was shocked that it's actually very true.

milkiway-26141,"The Kerala Story is a powerful and thought-provoking film that tackles the controversial and sensitive issue of Love Jihad. The film revolves around the story of Shalini Unnikrishnan, Nimah, and Geetanjali, who become victims of a Love Jihad ploy orchestrated by an ISIS aide.

The performances by the entire cast, especially Adah Sharma's award-winning portrayal of Shalini, were remarkable. The film's technical aspects, including the locations, cinematography, editing, and music, were all top-notch.

The film's depiction of violence and rape can be disturbing for some viewers. However, it was necessary to showcase the plight of the 32,000 Non-Muslim Indian girls from Kerala who were brainwashed, converted, impregnated, and sent to terror camps, raped, and ended up as sex slaves in ISIS camps in Syria and Afghanistan.

The film didn't portray Islam in a negative light and even showed its respect for the religion in some instances. The dialogues related to religion were thought-provoking and elicited both laughs and moments of reflection.

Overall, The Kerala Story is a must-watch for those who appreciated The Kashmir Files. The film is made in a bold and uncompromising manner and offers a realistic and poignant experience. However, it's recommended only for strong hearts due to its intense subject matter.

Director Sudipto Sen and the entire cast and crew deserve praise for their efforts in bringing such an important issue to the forefront through cinema. The Kerala Story is not just a film but a call to action for society to address and combat Love Jihad.",,6 May 2023,10/10

The story of Fatima Ba is likely to be an emotional and thought-provoking journey that sheds light on the power of manipulation and the dangers of religious fanaticism. The film has the potential to spark important discussions about the impact of terrorism on individuals and society, as well as the need to combat extremism in all its forms. However, it is difficult to assess the movie's execution or quality without having seen it. Overall, ""The Converted"" sounds like an important and timely film that has the potential to make a significant impact.

The movie features powerful performances from its ensemble cast, and the direction is skillful in building tension and suspense throughout the narrative. The film is well-researched and presents a controversial topic that raises important questions about politics, power, and human rights.

Movie is a real and authentic portrayal of what was happened in mainland Kerala and happening in north Kerala(Malabar), Dakshin Kannada and Western Tamilnadu region. Spine Chilling and frightening. Any culture/civilization / society which fails to save their women from external predators is doomed to become extinct. Needless to say which culture / civilization and whose ethos are endangered. Time to come out of perpetual denial mode and be extra careful, extra watchful and extra vigilant.",,5 May 2023,10/10
krishtealovestealove-81469,"The Kerala Story is a movie that delves into the issue of alleged radicalization and forced conversion of young Hindu women to Islam in Kerala, after which they are coerced into joining ISIS. The movie is based on a true story of three young girls from different parts of Kerala, and the role of Shalini/Fatima is played by Adah Sharma, who delivers a powerful and emotionally stirring performance.

The director Sudipto Sen has chosen a sensitive and complex subject, and the treatment of the film is said to be difficult to watch with several disturbing scenes, moments and dialogues. However, some reviews suggest that the treatment gets increasingly guided more by local politics than cinematic sagacity. While the movie does have some poignant moments, for the most part, it is either the gullible girls eager to buy the propaganda or sly creatures with Muslim names; there is no voice of sanity, and nuance is nowhere to be found.

The movie also features the narration of a converted Muslim woman, Fatima Ba, who shares her story of being abducted from her home and manipulated by religious vanguards to become an ISIS terrorist, eventually landing her in an Afghanistan jail.

The Kerala Story is a movie that highlights a critical issue that is currently affecting many parts of the world, and it is commendable that the director has chosen to bring attention to this subject. The movie attempts to showcase the harrowing experiences of the young girls who are forced to convert and join ISIS, and the emotional toll that this takes on them and their families. Adah Sharma's performance as Shalini/Fatima is powerful, and she brings depth and nuance to her character.

However, as some reviews suggest, the movie could have delved deeper into the issue and provided more nuanced and balanced portrayals of the characters involved. While it is important to raise awareness about the issue of forced conversions and radicalization, it is also important to avoid stereotyping and demonizing entire communities, which can fuel existing biases and prejudices.

Overall, The Kerala Story is a movie that attempts to shine a light on a critical issue, and the performances of the actors, especially Adah Sharma, are noteworthy. However, the treatment of the film could have been more nuanced and balanced to provide a deeper understanding of the complex issues involved. It is a movie worth watching, but with the understanding that it portrays a highly sensitive subject that needs to be examined with care and caution.",,5 May 2023,10/10

This particular film, based on a real story, is one such movie that everyone should watch. It is an eye-opener that sheds light on a social issue that is often overlooked or ignored.

The performances by the cast are outstanding, with each actor bringing their character to life with sincerity and authenticity. The film's powerful message is conveyed through its poignant storytelling and realistic portrayal of the events that unfold.

The true story of how a girl in Kerala, pursuing a Masters degree away from home, is brainwashed by the radical community there, to turn against her family and her faith. She and other students are manipulated by a radical roommate and some male friends into sleazy relationships in the name of 'love'.

rohonnag,"Movies can entertain, they can invoke new ideas and sometimes they can bring about change. Change of thought process, change of perspective etc. This is a movie that changes your perception of the world we live in, especially if you don't know what sort of things are happening around us hidden in plain sight.

This is a movie which is difficult to watch. Not because it is not well made, but because it shows the stark-naked truth in such a simple and devastating manner. Things that happen to the women in this film which is based on real life incidents are not for the weak of stomach. But it's the reality we live in and most would find it convenient to ignore the truth rather than confront it.

As a film, the cinematography is good, the camera work is organic and not overly dramatic. There are some dramatic shots, but those are needed to set the tone of the film. The look and feel of the film seem more real than fictional. This movie feels very authentic in its tonality and stands apart from typical Bollywood films like Kabul Express, Fanaa or Kurbaan.

The narrative of the film is nonlinear. It follows roughly three different timelines of the same person. First one of her being in college, another of her in Afghanistan and the last one of her incarcerated at an UN detention camp. The scenes flow mostly seamlessly from one timeline to the other. Sometimes the shift in tonality from a happy and positive interaction in the past to a rather bleak and grim present is done intentionally to jar the audience and shake them from their slumber (figuratively speaking) of believing all is right in the world just because they can't see such things happening in front of them.

All the songs in the film are either used in montage scenes or in the background. There is no waste of time entertainment dance numbers or anything overtly filmi when it comes to the music. The background score is used sparingly but is effective.

Overall: As a film, this is a very tragic subject matter. It's hard to make it through the movie without some sort of emotional reaction, be it sadness, depression or sheer anger. The movie is meant to evoke such reactions. That's what showing the truth as plainly as possible does to the masses. So be warned, this is a film that is hard hitting and not a fun time pass sort of watch. Don't go in with a bunch of friends expecting to have a good time.

Go see it with friends and family to open their eyes on what is going on and what might happen to someone they know and love if we as a society don't hold the people doing such inhuman acts accountable for their actions. This is a film that every Indian needs to see. Its an absolute must watch.

Rating: 7.5/10.

Conclusion: There are no negatives as such in the film, but maybe due to censor board, scenes that are showing the conversion to radical thought process did feel a bit truncated. Some moments of the film could have lingered a tad bit more to hammer the point home. But those are minor gripes in an otherwise well-made film about a very tragic and intense subject matter.",,5 May 2023,8/10

munmoonghosh-48734,"This movie shows how women are recruited to be sent to IS. The whole journey is way too disturbing! But young girls must watch this movie so that they dont believe everything in the name of love.

Adah Sharma nailed the show!!! The background music could have been better though. The other supporting characters were bringing the best in Adah Sharma.

If you are looking for a masala movie then it is not your cup of tea. It is based on a very sensitive topic. It will make you uncomfortable.

The people in India act too sophisticated to not discuss what all is happening in the name of religion. We must make ourselves comfortable and stop fearing that we are judged if we speak the truth about the conversion games.",,6 May 2023,10/10

I wish that after witnessing this movie, justice would be served, or that at the very least, an investigation would be launched.

I am NOT any ideology or party/AGENDA supporter, but I must say this is one of the best movies I have seen in recent times. It shows a very detailed situation of terrorism and it's strategic planning not only in war but in the terms of soft war and brainwashing people. Irrespective of the controversy whether the cases are 32000 or 3, one must understand that even if the case is only ONE still this is what the terrorist have agenda.

ashwinnagar,"The movie Kerala Story is a poignant and thought-provoking portrayal of the dangers and devastation wrought by ISIS terror, particularly in the Indian state of Kerala, which has a large Muslim population. The film sheds light on how ISIS recruits non-Muslim women from Kerala through deceitful means, and then puts them in harm's way on the battlefield, making their lives a living hell. It is a powerful wake-up call for the world to confront the evil designs of this terrorist organization.

Through its gripping narrative and powerful visuals, the movie exposes the insidious tactics used by ISIS to lure young non-Muslim girls, convert them to Islam, and then use them for their own nefarious purposes. The film highlights the stark reality of the situation and makes us aware of the urgent need to act against such heinous acts.

Overall, Kerala Story is a must-watch movie that provides a stark reminder of the dangers posed by terrorism and the need for vigilance against it.

Some people have not even watched the movie and calling it against a religion, but there is nothing about any religion in the movie this movie is all about how ISIS Operates and their modus oprandi around the world.

vtmathewm,"I watched the movie after seeing positive reviews.

Sadly disappointed. As a Keralite it was pushing the limits of my intelligence and sense to watch the pathetic screenplay. Nursing students molested in a Mall in full public view, in Kerala?? No one reacts, not even mobile phone and online media warriors? Come on.

Nursing students seen taking pills given to them just as if it was the most normal thing to do. Even kids would be wary. Whoever wrote the screenplay needs to get a reality check.

A mother whose daughter is missing for long, gets a surprise call from her later from Afghanistan, and she has for her mushy dialogues, like how does it feel to be a mother.

I saw the Hindi version, for some inexplicable reason all actors speak Hindi with a Malayalam accent and Malyalam with a Hindi accent. You can't be both.

At the end, they say they have filed an RTI to verify their own claims of numbers. It's your own claim! You have to provide proof.

For me, it's Just a hype created by people.

I don't Care about what others say. The movie is just completely pointless. It feels unnatural.

Its not worth the hype for which people are going Crazy.

The movie claims to be inspired by real-life events, but it seems to be entirely baseless and lacks any real substance. The plot is all over the place, and it's difficult to understand what is happening. The characters are poorly developed, and their motivations are unclear. The dialogues are unconvincing.

Its only the Acting of the Talented Actors which doesn't feel unnatural and feels real.

Despite the movie's claims to be inspired by real-life events, there is no sense of realism or authenticity. The story seems to be fabricated to attract audiences, and the title seems to be a mere marketing ploy. The movie fails to deliver any real emotional impact or make a meaningful statement.

Adah Sharma was able to bring out the emotions and feelings of the audience as it was required from her as an actor. From the South Indian accent to some clap-worthy dialogues, Adah was a treat to watch on the big screen. Sudipto Sen majorly focused on three 'true stories', he did bring out his creative work by not just showing the dark elements but also giving refreshments to his audience by showing the beautiful views of Kerala, a South Indian household, and some college moments. Not only he focused on the plight of the three women but also on the pain that was inflicted on the families. Each woman's story was different from the other but yet connected by the same thread - Terrorism.

Anonymous_ly,"The movie stays to the point for the entire length, the effort to make it in such a way that a typical Indian woman can connect to her daily life, is evident. The parts that appear exaggeratingly violent are unfortunately, factually correct.

The only curse of the movie is that the people have a very rigid perception about the movie, the audience is highly polarized, those who'll watch will support & those who won't will oppose, in all this, the efforts to address an immediate need for a mass level awareness about mainstream beliefs of world's fastest growing religion, are compromised.

One area where it succeeds fully, is in conveying the sorrow of the women portrayed.

Several areas of improvement could be pointed out in terms of subtlety of story & script writing, but they would make the movie irrelevant for the Indian masses.

It'd be difficult for the movie to reach the audiences who need to: watch it / add another perspective to how they look at things.",,6 May 2023,8/10

rahulvadap,"The way the movie is shot, directed and the background music is fantastic, especially the Kurdish song at the end will leave you numb.

Full marks to Adah Sharma for acting and also to the Sonia Balani the girl who plays the role of Asifa. You will get angry seeing her on screen meaning she has done a fantastic job at potraying her character.

You dont feel you are watching the movie but a documentary.

Immense research has gone into the movie of 7 years. Director Sudipto Sen has spoken how he visited Kerala several times in past 7yrs to reseach on the subject and that research shows in the film.

Do not pay attention to the negative press and go watch the movie then do some basic research you will understand what's the reality.

Full marks of chosing the subject and bringing such a movie to light.",,5 May 2023,10/10
mypapa-04559,"This is in real sense called a movie. No hype, no over rated star casts of bollywood but BIG on the story line, a true story of many... These kind of movies takes arduous effort by the movie makers and each of their crew.

Since this movie was made after a few years of research about the horrendus situation of illegal religious conversion in the Indian state of Kerala (actually in most states of India and even in some parts of the world, for e.g. In the UK), it has justfied its aspect for which it has been made!

Can't stop praising about the skills of the actors in portraying their characters of the real incidents (even happening now) in India.

pirtaesking,"""The Converted"" appears to be a movie that tackles important and relevant themes related to religious extremism and terrorism. The story of Fatima Ba is likely to be an emotional and thought-provoking journey that sheds light on the power of manipulation and the dangers of religious fanaticism. The film has the potential to spark important discussions about the impact of terrorism on individuals and society, as well as the need to combat extremism in all its forms. However, it is difficult to assess the movie's execution or quality without having seen it. Overall, ""The Converted"" sounds like an important and timely film that has the potential to make a significant impact.

The movie features powerful performances from its ensemble cast, and the direction is skillful in building tension and suspense throughout the narrative. The film is well-researched and presents a controversial topic that raises important questions about politics, power, and human rights. However, some viewers may find the film's portrayal of certain individuals or groups to be biased or one-sided.

Any culture/civilization / society which fails to save their women from external predators is doomed to become extinct. Needless to say which culture / civilization and whose ethos are endangered.

krishtealovestealove-81469,"The Kerala Story is a movie that delves into the issue of alleged radicalization and forced conversion of young Hindu women to Islam in Kerala, after which they are coerced into joining ISIS. The movie is based on a true story of three young girls from different parts of Kerala, and the role of Shalini/Fatima is played by Adah Sharma, who delivers a powerful and emotionally stirring performance.

The director Sudipto Sen has chosen a sensitive and complex subject, and the treatment of the film is said to be difficult to watch with several disturbing scenes, moments and dialogues. However, some reviews suggest that the treatment gets increasingly guided more by local politics than cinematic sagacity. While the movie does have some poignant moments, for the most part, it is either the gullible girls eager to buy the propaganda or sly creatures with Muslim names; there is no voice of sanity, and nuance is nowhere to be found.

The movie also features the narration of a converted Muslim woman, Fatima Ba, who shares her story of being abducted from her home and manipulated by religious vanguards to become an ISIS terrorist, eventually landing her in an Afghanistan jail.

The Kerala Story is a movie that highlights a critical issue that is currently affecting many parts of the world, and it is commendable that the director has chosen to bring attention to this subject. The movie attempts to showcase the harrowing experiences of the young girls who are forced to convert and join ISIS, and the emotional toll that this takes on them and their families. Adah Sharma's performance as Shalini/Fatima is powerful, and she brings depth and nuance to her character.

However, as some reviews suggest, the movie could have delved deeper into the issue and provided more nuanced and balanced portrayals of the characters involved. While it is important to raise awareness about the issue of forced conversions and radicalization, it is also important to avoid stereotyping and demonizing entire communities, which can fuel existing biases and prejudices.

Overall, The Kerala Story is a movie that attempts to shine a light on a critical issue, and the performances of the actors, especially Adah Sharma, are noteworthy. However, the treatment of the film could have been more nuanced and balanced to provide a deeper understanding of the complex issues involved. It is a movie worth watching, but with the understanding that it portrays a highly sensitive subject that needs to be examined with care and caution.",,5 May 2023,10/10

nitsvirusboyz,"The Kerala Story is a hard-hitting, shocking, and disturbing film that leaves the viewers with a feeling of discomfort. The story of the film revolves around love-jihad, brutal inhuman crimes such as rape, sex slavery, radicalisation, indoctrination, and ISIS recruitment. Even if the shreds of evidence are lacking, the makers would like you to believe that these events are inspired by true incidents. If you still don't believe that then the victim and the parents of the victims speak at the end of the movie making it more believable.

The director and writers of the film managed to keep the story intriguing. The dialogues are powerful but few are manipulative and it tries to provoke hate. The first half is engaging, fast-paced, and quickly introduces us to three nursing students in Kerala who are brainwashed by an extremist group and makes them believe that only Islam can be their saviour. The screenplay in the second half is engrossing and keeps you hooked until the end of the film. The parallel storylines showing the past and present scenes are well-edited and well-balanced.

Adah Sharma delivers a praiseworthy performance and she has done complete justice to the character of vulnerable Shalini. Her Malayali accent is spot on. Yogita Bihani and Siddhi Idnani played their part very well. Sonia Balani's dialogue delivery and her performance as Asifa was excellent. Other supporting actors played their parts with utmost sincerity.

swaroopnagraj,"The film is an eye-opener. Every Indian should watch this no matter their religion or state. Because this movie shows the truth about Monotheistic Abrahamic religions which only believe in one God and completely reject people belonging to other faiths.

The movie shows the raw stories that happen in countries of the Middle-east, where ISIS and other terror organizations operate. The movie doesn't shy away from depicting blood and gore that is common to desert cultures and people.

People are saying that the makers of the movie lied and that they don't have any proof over the claims of 32,000 women from Kerala being took to Syria. But I would like to ask all of those people, that even if 1 girl has gone through such a blood-curdling experience, isn't this fact itself more than enough to make a movie about the girl's life and why she choose this path.

The purpose of the film is mainly to create awareness and prevent such things from happening in the future and the movie has done an amazing job in this regard. As the message is loud and clear, that anyone who has grand foolish dreams about the ""After-life"" and decides to take the path mentioned in the film, will end up in the same situation as the girl depicted in the movie.

Overall, Sudipto Sen has done an amazing job. The film feels like its almost taken out from a Documentary shot in Syria or Afghanistan. The actors were brilliant especially Adah Sharma, who has done a terrific job and if I may say so, put her ""HEAD"" on the line to make this movie a success. So she deserves all the applause.

Finally, I would like to say that movies are made and released almost every week. But to make a movie like this which shows hardcore facts and throws these facts on the face of those people who are in denial of such obnoxious truths that is happening not only in Kerala, but also in developed countries like US and UK, is praise-worthy and requires some serious balls which Sudipto has proven he has.",,5 May 2023,10/10

From our childhood we have been told to keep quiet on everything even if it's a wrong thing, they run fake propaganda agenda like PK and try to ban real events.

moviebluffhere,"Kerala Story must be lauded not because it's an exceptional piece of cinema - or that it subverts some conventions in filmmaking. In fact, on the technical front, it is mediocre at best BUT it is brave attempt to showcase, and perhaps start a conversation about the cultural programming against a community and their religion. It succeeds in capturing the potential of radicalism in Islam, it's dangerous insistence on being non-accepting of other religions, and most importantly it's violent canvassing for the name of ""Allah"" at the cost of subjecting others to absolute cruelty.

It also presents, though a messy, picture of the politics at play. But as was previously mentioned, the movie needs to be lauded because it is unapologetic and thankfully not politically correct. The angst, the contained pain is visible.

Adah Sharma is very convincing in her role, and so are the other two new comers. The music is a little off putting but overall, being an important film it must be watched at least once. Perhaps, it's one of the earlier movies that are going to deal with this subject in a more mature manner. But I'm not going to deduct stars for that.

lakshmishaks88,"""The Kerala Story"" is a compelling and thought-provoking film that sheds light on a subject that has remained untold for far too long. Inspired by true incidents, the movie follows the journey of Shalini Unnikrishnan, played brilliantly by Adah Sharma, as she navigates a dangerous world.

Director Sen employs a shock-and-awe approach, similar to ""The Kashmir Files,"" which adds to the film's compelling nature. The visuals are powerful from the start, with Shalini portrayed as a trapped and manipulated victim. Adah Sharma delivers a bold performance, capturing the essence of her character and bringing attention to the challenges faced by individuals in similar situations.

The plot revolves around Shalini, a student who moves to Kasargod to pursue her studies. There, she encounters three roommates from different backgrounds, setting the stage for intense discussions and exploration of diverse ideologies. These thought-provoking debates raise questions about faith and add depth to the narrative.

As the story unfolds, Shalini faces orchestrated social situations designed to exploit her vulnerability. The film delves into the tactics used by manipulative individuals, shedding light on the methods employed to exert control and influence. Sen provides valuable insight into the complexities of manipulation and radicalization.

Adah Sharma and the supporting cast deliver commendable performances, portraying their characters with authenticity and emotional depth. Their portrayal adds credibility to the narrative, capturing the struggles faced by victims and evoking empathy from the audience.

""The Kerala Story"" also addresses the need for broader conversations about individual freedoms and the protection of human rights. It prompts viewers to reflect on societal norms and the importance of understanding diverse perspectives.

The post-credits scene is particularly moving, as the film includes testimonials from real-life victims' families. This raw and emotional footage serves as a reminder of the real-world impact of extremism and the pain endured by those affected. It leaves a lasting impact on the audience.

While the storyboarding could benefit from further refinement, the filmmakers and crew deserve recognition for their courage in tackling a sensitive subject. By bringing awareness to the struggles faced by victims, they shed light on an important issue that demands attention.

""The Kerala Story"" is a film that should be seen by many, as it brings awareness to the challenges and experiences of victims. It encourages viewers to consider the power of manipulation and serves as a reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding.",,10 May 2023,9/10

The movie emphasised too much on the cross borders of Islamic countries rather than the main content of brain washing and converting to other religion

The content is very tough and is hard to accept the pain of these girls who were influenced to change their minds ,thoughts and religions by a group of separatists

Adah gave a fabulous performance from innocent to militant with good support from other fellow actors

Some scenes were too harsh and were not easy to digest only if you are mentally strong then only go for this movie..the pain has been elongated too much

nadkarnisumeet,"The Kerala Story review :

Not as hard hitting and engaging as The Kashmir Files (2022), The Kerala Story is still a pertinent take on the religious conversions which we keep hearing in the news. The fact that these Hindu women were not just converted but also instigated to join the ISIS as sex slaves makes for a chilling and compelling watch.

The subtle manner in which the brain washing starts... and where it finally ends is accurately depicted in the movie. The desert locales have an authentic look and the performances from the entire cast, particularly Adah Sharma is first rate. Vipul Amrutlal Shah has touched a daringly realistic subject this time and done fair justice to it though the film has its share of flaws.

The background score jars at times. The Malayalam dialogues with sudden Hindi words in between don't work. And frankly, the easy peasy way in which the two nursing students get convinced by their conniving roommate to change their religion appears a tad too convenient from a writing perspective. The entire brain washing process needed more gravitas..

Having said that, The Kerala Story is a relevant piece of cinema. Such 'love jihad' incidents have indeed taken place and will continue until we have strict enforceable laws in place. This film will at least pose as a warning or a deterrant to the impressionable youngsters falling in to this vicious trap. Recommended stuff!!

This movie is an eye opener for all apologists who think only one side needs to believe any truth that is fed to them. The shock factor in this movie was absolutely necessary and it brought out the pain of thousands of women who have been brainwashed to go through the conversion hell and is still happening in different parts of the country, not just Kerala. The entire process of how Hindu and Christian women are targeted and then systematically made to hate their own religion and beliefs, so that they can be converted, is shown without any censorship. This movie also portrays how important it is for parents to teach their kids about the right things before it's too late.",,12 May 2023,10/10
anjanashrestha2,"The moment I heard about this movie, I wanted to watch it. I did not have much expectations wrt the direction and the execution of the movie considering the challenging nature of the subject matter. So, I went to watch it ready to accept its subpar performance.

The movie was as expected. The cinematography of the deserts of Afghanistan was very beautiful. The depiction of the people and the culture shown was convincing to me (I haven't done any fact-checking but going with what the movie shows). Credit goes to the individual who conceptualized and captured those locations.

By watching the movie, yes, you understand how the so-called naïve girls are radicalized. However, the radicalization part has been a bit overdone and emphasized a bit more. It lacked the subtleties and the nuances but as I mentioned before, I was expecting that by the look of the trailers. That over-emphasis part can be paralleled with the movie ""3 idiots"" where the characters overplay to explain a point. It looks like the movie makers want to make sure that everyone understood the message loud and clear.

Having said that, the performance from the characters seemed a bit scripted, who otherewise looked talented. I should however commend on Adah Sharma's performance. Given the movies I watched of her (Haseen to Phaseen and Commando 2 or 3), I think this movie gave her a big break. It may even nominate her for the best performance (female) in the movie awards next year. (In fact, the movie itself may earn a couple of nominations.) She may have missed some nuances here and there but that is forgivable, at least to me, given that she still executed the tough role with such determination and courage. Kudos to her!

I am happy that the movie did well. If movies like Pathaan can break the box office, I really think The Kerala Story definitely deserves a chance. It has touched upon such an important issue. Once again, I don't know the facts but given that this is based on a true story, it reflects the ugly truths of the society. It at least makes people think, create an awareness and have them digging for facts. I would any day go and watch and support movies like these than going for Pathaan or like movies. I am not trying to say they are not good or entertaining but I am not drawn to movies that attract people solely by the virtue of big stars, bodies and glamour.

TKS is a movie that is very different and probably the first one in Hindi language (not sure about others) that has been made in the topic. Kudos to the movie makers for making that and for making us think.",,13 May 2023,7/10
erdzenforpublic,"Alert : Review based on film Not Story This movie is not for my type of neutral audience, as if want to spend for some cinematic experience.

Cinematography is the thing which will disappoint you and after all film is not marketed for its cinematography, and for a small budget film this is still impressive.

Let's talk about storytelling it is better I will not say best as there are still many flaws in that but not so boring.

Accuracy: Although the story is about terriorism but still many at many instances it feels tooo.. exaggerated, like for where are the sources.

So after all If you just an neutral I will suggest to go for guardian of the galaxy. And if you want to see this movie for what it has been marketed then please go.",,5 May 2023,1/10

All the location of this movie is very good each and every actor given 200% for this movie.

Ada Sharma doing great job.

You will never feel bore in the movie. The timing of every scene and song picturise perfectly.

Some more features can be added in this movie like Halala and Triple Talak director has the space for it but he avoided this issues.

samujjwalchowdhury,"The movie shows the true side of Love Jihad. How Hindu girls are trapped and brainwashed to convert into Islam. Whether the movie is a true story or not but still this movie doesn't disappoint you to know about Love Jihad unlike Toofaan who justifies it. Adah Sharma's acting was perfect. The movie have flaws too. It focuses too much on Adah Sharma not the other two girls. The Screenplay is too loose and the climax could be better than that. Asifa's character requires more screen presence. Rest I will recommend all the Hindu girls to watch this masterpiece. And the people who are calling it Islamophobic, the film potray ISIS in a negative light not Islam.",,6 May 2023,10/10

rohonnag,"Movies can entertain, they can invoke new ideas and sometimes they can bring about change. Change of thought process, change of perspective etc. This is a movie that changes your perception of the world we live in, especially if you don't know what sort of things are happening around us hidden in plain sight.

This is a movie which is difficult to watch. Not because it is not well made, but because it shows the stark-naked truth in such a simple and devastating manner. Things that happen to the women in this film which is based on real life incidents are not for the weak of stomach. But it's the reality we live in and most would find it convenient to ignore the truth rather than confront it.

As a film, the cinematography is good, the camera work is organic and not overly dramatic. There are some dramatic shots, but those are needed to set the tone of the film. The look and feel of the film seem more real than fictional. This movie feels very authentic in its tonality and stands apart from typical Bollywood films like Kabul Express, Fanaa or Kurbaan.

The narrative of the film is nonlinear. It follows roughly three different timelines of the same person. First one of her being in college, another of her in Afghanistan and the last one of her incarcerated at an UN detention camp. The scenes flow mostly seamlessly from one timeline to the other. Sometimes the shift in tonality from a happy and positive interaction in the past to a rather bleak and grim present is done intentionally to jar the audience and shake them from their slumber (figuratively speaking) of believing all is right in the world just because they can't see such things happening in front of them.

All the songs in the film are either used in montage scenes or in the background. There is no waste of time entertainment dance numbers or anything overtly filmi when it comes to the music. The background score is used sparingly but is effective.

Overall: As a film, this is a very tragic subject matter. It's hard to make it through the movie without some sort of emotional reaction, be it sadness, depression or sheer anger. The movie is meant to evoke such reactions. That's what showing the truth as plainly as possible does to the masses. So be warned, this is a film that is hard hitting and not a fun time pass sort of watch. Don't go in with a bunch of friends expecting to have a good time.

Go see it with friends and family to open their eyes on what is going on and what might happen to someone they know and love if we as a society don't hold the people doing such inhuman acts accountable for their actions. This is a film that every Indian needs to see. Its an absolute must watch.

Rating: 7.5/10.

Conclusion: There are no negatives as such in the film, but maybe due to censor board, scenes that are showing the conversion to radical thought process did feel a bit truncated. Some moments of the film could have lingered a tad bit more to hammer the point home. But those are minor gripes in an otherwise well-made film about a very tragic and intense subject matter.",,5 May 2023,8/10

I really keep this movie to show to my kids now they are too small but once they get maturity i will show them every year so that they don't forget and always learn.

munmoonghosh-48734,"This movie shows how women are recruited to be sent to IS. The whole journey is way too disturbing! But young girls must watch this movie so that they dont believe everything in the name of love.

Adah Sharma nailed the show!!! The background music could have been better though. The other supporting characters were bringing the best in Adah Sharma.

If you are looking for a masala movie then it is not your cup of tea. It is based on a very sensitive topic. It will make you uncomfortable.

The people in India act too sophisticated to not discuss what all is happening in the name of religion. We must make ourselves comfortable and stop fearing that we are judged if we speak the truth about the conversion games.",,6 May 2023,10/10

limitedwatersupplied,"'The Kerala Story' narrates the tales of three young girls from various regions of Kerala, with the primary focus on the story of Shalini, who is abducted and subsequently converted to Islam. Shalini is then radicalized. And compelled to join ISIS as a terrorist.

'The Kerala Story' is centered around the alleged radicalization and conversion of young Hindu women to Islam in Kerala, after which they are forced to join ISIS. The film states that it's a true story of three young girls from different parts of Kerala.

I am NOT any ideology or party/AGENDA supporter, but I must say this is one of the best movies I have seen in recent times. It shows a very detailed situation of terrorism and it's strategic planning not only in war but in the terms of soft war and brainwashing people. Irrespective of the controversy whether the cases are 32000 or 3, one must understand that even if the case is only ONE still this is what the terrorist have agenda.

Besides the message I must say the acting is done very well by the characters. You will not be bored in the entire duration of the movie. Whether or not you think of this as agenda or truth do watch for the actors and storyline.",,6 May 2023,10/10
vamshi_vemula,"The movie industry is constantly evolving and has the power to influence the way people think and act. Some movies are made solely for entertainment purposes while others have a more profound meaning and leave a lasting impact on their audience. It takes a great deal of courage and conviction to produce a movie that is based on true events and deals with sensitive topics. Kudos to the movie makers for taking up this challenge and creating a film that sheds light on a real-life incident.

Making a movie that is based on true events is no small feat. The filmmakers have to ensure that the facts are accurate and that they do justice to the story. At the same time, they have to be mindful of the emotions of the people involved and the impact that the movie might have on them. Choosing a sensitive topic for a movie requires a lot of research and a deep understanding of the subject matter. The filmmakers have to be sensitive to the issue and must approach it with care and empathy.

It is commendable that the movie makers did not back down and released the movie against all odds. They took the risk of being criticized and chose to stand by their beliefs. It is a testament to their commitment to the story and their dedication to creating a meaningful movie.

The movie is based on true events, which makes it all the more important to watch. It is a real-life story that has the potential to leave a lasting impact on the audience.

Also movie shows we are not teaching our kids about our religion, culture and roots and therefore they are not aligning with us instead they aling with others.

ashwinnagar,"The movie Kerala Story is a poignant and thought-provoking portrayal of the dangers and devastation wrought by ISIS terror, particularly in the Indian state of Kerala, which has a large Muslim population. The film sheds light on how ISIS recruits non-Muslim women from Kerala through deceitful means, and then puts them in harm's way on the battlefield, making their lives a living hell. It is a powerful wake-up call for the world to confront the evil designs of this terrorist organization.

Through its gripping narrative and powerful visuals, the movie exposes the insidious tactics used by ISIS to lure young non-Muslim girls, convert them to Islam, and then use them for their own nefarious purposes. The film highlights the stark reality of the situation and makes us aware of the urgent need to act against such heinous acts.

Overall, Kerala Story is a must-watch movie that provides a stark reminder of the dangers posed by terrorism and the need for vigilance against it. It is a powerful call to action for people all over the world to stand up against terrorism and fight for the protection of innocent lives.",,5 May 2023,10/10

vtmathewm,"I watched the movie after seeing positive reviews.

Sadly disappointed. As a Keralite it was pushing the limits of my intelligence and sense to watch the pathetic screenplay. Nursing students molested in a Mall in full public view, in Kerala?? No one reacts, not even mobile phone and online media warriors? Come on.

Nursing students seen taking pills given to them just as if it was the most normal thing to do. Even kids would be wary. Whoever wrote the screenplay needs to get a reality check.

A mother whose daughter is missing for long, gets a surprise call from her later from Afghanistan, and she has for her mushy dialogues, like how does it feel to be a mother.

I saw the Hindi version, for some inexplicable reason all actors speak Hindi with a Malayalam accent and Malyalam with a Hindi accent. You can't be both.

At the end, they say they have filed an RTI to verify their own claims of numbers. It's your own claim! You have to provide proof.

bivuinc,"'The Kerala Story' begins in the interrogation room where Shalini (Adah Sharma) is revealing details of her horrific and tragic past and the reason why she is in a situation of crisis. Her backstory revolves around four college students who have enrolled in a Nursing School in Kasargauda, Kerala. The story is narrated from the perspective of Shalini, who shares a deep bond with her roommates Gitanjali (Siddhi Idnani), Nimah (Yogita Bihani), and Asifa (Sonia Balani). Unbeknownst to others, Asifa has a secret agenda to expose and convert her roommates to Islam. With the assistance of her male associates from outside, she ensures that the girls are radicalized and indoctrinated into the religion using hallucinogenic drugs. After Shalini becomes pregnant, she is compelled to marry someone other than the man who impregnated her, and then embarks on a long journey to Syria via Pakistan and Afghanistan.

At certain points, the film feels more like a tutorial of radicalization than entertainment for the audience. It also goes to extremes to make its point, and that could be quite unsettling for audiences belonging to various communities in our country. After watching 'The Kerala Story,' you may be left with several questions about the current state of the country.

For me, it's Just a hype created by people.

I don't Care about what others say. The movie is just completely pointless. It feels unnatural.

Its not worth the hype for which people are going Crazy.

The movie claims to be inspired by real-life events, but it seems to be entirely baseless and lacks any real substance. The plot is all over the place, and it's difficult to understand what is happening. The characters are poorly developed, and their motivations are unclear. The dialogues are unconvincing.

Its only the Acting of the Talented Actors which doesn't feel unnatural and feels real.

Despite the movie's claims to be inspired by real-life events, there is no sense of realism or authenticity. The story seems to be fabricated to attract audiences, and the title seems to be a mere marketing ploy. The movie fails to deliver any real emotional impact or make a meaningful statement.

singhakshat-54646,"The four main actors in the film - Adah Sharma, Yogita Bihani, Siddhi Idnani, Sonia Balani, did a good job and justified their performances. Adah Sharma was able to bring out the emotions and feelings of the audience as it was required from her as an actor. From the South Indian accent to some clap-worthy dialogues, Adah was a treat to watch on the big screen. Sudipto Sen majorly focused on three 'true stories', he did bring out his creative work by not just showing the dark elements but also giving refreshments to his audience by showing the beautiful views of Kerala, a South Indian household, and some college moments. Not only he focused on the plight of the three women but also on the pain that was inflicted on the families. Each woman's story was different from the other but yet connected by the same thread - Terrorism.

Anonymous_ly,"The movie stays to the point for the entire length, the effort to make it in such a way that a typical Indian woman can connect to her daily life, is evident. The parts that appear exaggeratingly violent are unfortunately, factually correct.

The only curse of the movie is that the people have a very rigid perception about the movie, the audience is highly polarized, those who'll watch will support & those who won't will oppose, in all this, the efforts to address an immediate need for a mass level awareness about mainstream beliefs of world's fastest growing religion, are compromised.

One area where it succeeds fully, is in conveying the sorrow of the women portrayed.

Several areas of improvement could be pointed out in terms of subtlety of story & script writing, but they would make the movie irrelevant for the Indian masses.

It'd be difficult for the movie to reach the audiences who need to: watch it / add another perspective to how they look at things.",,6 May 2023,8/10

Every Indian should watch this movie and should be aware of these kind of incidents and the casting, direction and script is far better than any other than Bollywood movies released in 2023. The acting of addah sharma is very good along with other actors also done good acting and movies like this should be made which can raise awareness incidents like this.

arifnizamcynic,"Professedly based on ""many true stories"", The Kerala Story, directed by Sudipto Sen, isn't really interested in the truth as a whole. Taking the cases of a handful of missing girls, it spins a yarn that would have us believe that Kerala has contributed thousands of foot soldiers to ISIS over the years. Needless to say, that claim isn't backed up with either evidence or genuine concern.

No more than a lengthy WhatsApp forward in the guise of a movie, The Kerala Story would have been deemed a passable vehicle for a half-baked conspiracy theory had the film not been as laughably inept, both in terms of its making and its tonalities. It cannot by any stretch of the imagination be accused of being a balanced investigation.

A stray shot late in the film is enough to sum up what is wrong with The Kerala Story apart from its lopsided, selective and alarmist theorising about the state's global terror links. On a beach stands a dried-up tree that looks like a prop put there for no particular reason.",,5 May 2023,1/10

Full marks to Adah Sharma for acting and also to the Sonia Balani the girl who plays the role of Asifa. You will get angry seeing her on screen meaning she has done a fantastic job at potraying her character.

You dont feel you are watching the movie but a documentary.

Immense research has gone into the movie of 7 years. Director Sudipto Sen has spoken how he visited Kerala several times in past 7yrs to reseach on the subject and that research shows in the film.

Do not pay attention to the negative press and go watch the movie then do some basic research you will understand what's the reality.

Full marks of chosing the subject and bringing such a movie to light.",,5 May 2023,10/10
mypapa-04559,"This is in real sense called a movie. No hype, no over rated star casts of bollywood but BIG on the story line, a true story of many... These kind of movies takes arduous effort by the movie makers and each of their crew.

Since this movie was made after a few years of research about the horrendus situation of illegal religious conversion in the Indian state of Kerala (actually in most states of India and even in some parts of the world, for e.g. In the UK), it has justfied its aspect for which it has been made!

Can't stop praising about the skills of the actors in portraying their characters of the real incidents (even happening now) in India.

itprowebsite,"""Keral Story"" is a gripping and thought-provoking film that explores the harsh realities faced by young girls in India who are coerced into converting to Islam and the subsequent struggles they face in adapting to their new way of life. Directed by the talented Naveen John, the film takes an unflinching look at the lives of these girls, and the obstacles they must overcome to find a sense of belonging in a society that has turned its back on them.

The film centers around the story of a young Hindu girl named Meenakshi (played by the talented Anjali Nair), who is forced to convert to Islam by her husband after their marriage. Her journey is one that is filled with heartbreak and struggle, as she tries to navigate the complex and often hostile world of her new religion.

One of the strengths of ""Keral Story"" is the way in which it portrays the complex and nuanced nature of religious conversion. The film does not take a simplistic approach to this subject, but rather explores the different motivations and factors that can lead someone to convert. In the case of Meenakshi, her conversion is motivated by love for her husband, but also by a desire to escape the poverty and hardship of her old life.

The film also does an excellent job of showing the ways in which conversion can be used as a tool of control and manipulation by those in power. Meenakshi's husband is portrayed as a domineering figure who uses religion as a means of exerting control over her, and it is clear that his motivations are not purely spiritual. This aspect of the film is particularly relevant in the context of contemporary India, where there has been a rise in incidents of forced conversion.

The performances in ""Keral Story"" are uniformly excellent, with Anjali Nair delivering a powerful and nuanced portrayal of Meenakshi. Her journey from a naive and vulnerable young girl to a strong and independent woman is both moving and inspiring, and Nair is able to convey a wide range of emotions with subtlety and skill.

The supporting cast is also impressive, with notable performances from Sudhi Koppa as Meenakshi's husband, and Surabhi Lakshmi as her friend and confidante. The chemistry between the actors feels natural and authentic, and the relationships between the characters are one of the film's strongest aspects.

One of the most striking elements of ""Keral Story"" is its visual style. The film is shot in a naturalistic and understated manner, with a focus on capturing the everyday details of life in rural India. The use of light and shadow is particularly effective, and the cinematography is able to convey a sense of the harsh beauty of the Indian landscape.

The film's soundtrack is also noteworthy, with a haunting and evocative score that complements the visuals perfectly. The use of traditional Indian instruments, such as the sitar and tabla, gives the film an authentic and immersive feel, and the music is able to convey the complex emotions of the characters with great subtlety and nuance.

Overall, ""Keral Story"" is a powerful and emotionally resonant film that deals with important issues in a sensitive and nuanced manner. The film's exploration of the complexities of religious conversion, and the ways in which it can be used as a tool of control, is particularly relevant in the context of contemporary India. The performances are uniformly excellent, and the visual and musical elements of the film are both impressive and effective. Director Naveen John has crafted a film that is both thought-provoking and moving, and ""Keral Story"" is a must-see for anyone interested in exploring the complexities of religion, gender, and power.",,5 May 2023,10/10

Frankly speaking I already had read news about Kerala youths caught in some terror attacks around the world but I never knew there was a whole racket that is run in Kerala by islamic kingpins to convert innocent non Muslim girls and sent them to Syria or khorasan to be ISIS brides . This movie was an eye opener, later when I researched on internet I was shocked that it's actually very true. Nimisha Sampath became Fatima isa, Sonia Sebastian became Ayesha and Merin Jacobs Pallanth an engineering graduate becomes Mariyam all radicalized and sent to Afghanistan.

milkiway-26141,"The Kerala Story is a powerful and thought-provoking film that tackles the controversial and sensitive issue of Love Jihad. The film revolves around the story of Shalini Unnikrishnan, Nimah, and Geetanjali, who become victims of a Love Jihad ploy orchestrated by an ISIS aide.

The performances by the entire cast, especially Adah Sharma's award-winning portrayal of Shalini, were remarkable. The film's technical aspects, including the locations, cinematography, editing, and music, were all top-notch.

The film's depiction of violence and rape can be disturbing for some viewers. However, it was necessary to showcase the plight of the 32,000 Non-Muslim Indian girls from Kerala who were brainwashed, converted, impregnated, and sent to terror camps, raped, and ended up as sex slaves in ISIS camps in Syria and Afghanistan.

The film didn't portray Islam in a negative light and even showed its respect for the religion in some instances. The dialogues related to religion were thought-provoking and elicited both laughs and moments of reflection.

Overall, The Kerala Story is a must-watch for those who appreciated The Kashmir Files. The film is made in a bold and uncompromising manner and offers a realistic and poignant experience. However, it's recommended only for strong hearts due to its intense subject matter.

Director Sudipto Sen and the entire cast and crew deserve praise for their efforts in bringing such an important issue to the forefront through cinema. The Kerala Story is not just a film but a call to action for society to address and combat Love Jihad.",,6 May 2023,10/10

pirtaesking,"""The Converted"" appears to be a movie that tackles important and relevant themes related to religious extremism and terrorism. The story of Fatima Ba is likely to be an emotional and thought-provoking journey that sheds light on the power of manipulation and the dangers of religious fanaticism. The film has the potential to spark important discussions about the impact of terrorism on individuals and society, as well as the need to combat extremism in all its forms. However, it is difficult to assess the movie's execution or quality without having seen it. Overall, ""The Converted"" sounds like an important and timely film that has the potential to make a significant impact.

The movie features powerful performances from its ensemble cast, and the direction is skillful in building tension and suspense throughout the narrative. The film is well-researched and presents a controversial topic that raises important questions about politics, power, and human rights.

krishtealovestealove-81469,"The Kerala Story is a movie that delves into the issue of alleged radicalization and forced conversion of young Hindu women to Islam in Kerala, after which they are coerced into joining ISIS. The movie is based on a true story of three young girls from different parts of Kerala, and the role of Shalini/Fatima is played by Adah Sharma, who delivers a powerful and emotionally stirring performance.

The director Sudipto Sen has chosen a sensitive and complex subject, and the treatment of the film is said to be difficult to watch with several disturbing scenes, moments and dialogues. However, some reviews suggest that the treatment gets increasingly guided more by local politics than cinematic sagacity. While the movie does have some poignant moments, for the most part, it is either the gullible girls eager to buy the propaganda or sly creatures with Muslim names; there is no voice of sanity, and nuance is nowhere to be found.

The movie also features the narration of a converted Muslim woman, Fatima Ba, who shares her story of being abducted from her home and manipulated by religious vanguards to become an ISIS terrorist, eventually landing her in an Afghanistan jail.

The Kerala Story is a movie that highlights a critical issue that is currently affecting many parts of the world, and it is commendable that the director has chosen to bring attention to this subject. The movie attempts to showcase the harrowing experiences of the young girls who are forced to convert and join ISIS, and the emotional toll that this takes on them and their families. Adah Sharma's performance as Shalini/Fatima is powerful, and she brings depth and nuance to her character.

However, as some reviews suggest, the movie could have delved deeper into the issue and provided more nuanced and balanced portrayals of the characters involved. While it is important to raise awareness about the issue of forced conversions and radicalization, it is also important to avoid stereotyping and demonizing entire communities, which can fuel existing biases and prejudices.

Overall, The Kerala Story is a movie that attempts to shine a light on a critical issue, and the performances of the actors, especially Adah Sharma, are noteworthy. However, the treatment of the film could have been more nuanced and balanced to provide a deeper understanding of the complex issues involved. It is a movie worth watching, but with the understanding that it portrays a highly sensitive subject that needs to be examined with care and caution.",,5 May 2023,10/10

nitsvirusboyz,"The Kerala Story is a hard-hitting, shocking, and disturbing film that leaves the viewers with a feeling of discomfort. The story of the film revolves around love-jihad, brutal inhuman crimes such as rape, sex slavery, radicalisation, indoctrination, and ISIS recruitment. Even if the shreds of evidence are lacking, the makers would like you to believe that these events are inspired by true incidents. If you still don't believe that then the victim and the parents of the victims speak at the end of the movie making it more believable.

The director and writers of the film managed to keep the story intriguing. The dialogues are powerful but few are manipulative and it tries to provoke hate. The first half is engaging, fast-paced, and quickly introduces us to three nursing students in Kerala who are brainwashed by an extremist group and makes them believe that only Islam can be their saviour. The screenplay in the second half is engrossing and keeps you hooked until the end of the film. The parallel storylines showing the past and present scenes are well-edited and well-balanced.

Adah Sharma delivers a praiseworthy performance and she has done complete justice to the character of vulnerable Shalini. Her Malayali accent is spot on. Yogita Bihani and Siddhi Idnani played their part very well. Sonia Balani's dialogue delivery and her performance as Asifa was excellent. Other supporting actors played their parts with utmost sincerity.

swaroopnagraj,"The film is an eye-opener. Every Indian should watch this no matter their religion or state. Because this movie shows the truth about Monotheistic Abrahamic religions which only believe in one God and completely reject people belonging to other faiths.

The movie shows the raw stories that happen in countries of the Middle-east, where ISIS and other terror organizations operate. The movie doesn't shy away from depicting blood and gore that is common to desert cultures and people.

People are saying that the makers of the movie lied and that they don't have any proof over the claims of 32,000 women from Kerala being took to Syria. But I would like to ask all of those people, that even if 1 girl has gone through such a blood-curdling experience, isn't this fact itself more than enough to make a movie about the girl's life and why she choose this path.

The purpose of the film is mainly to create awareness and prevent such things from happening in the future and the movie has done an amazing job in this regard. As the message is loud and clear, that anyone who has grand foolish dreams about the ""After-life"" and decides to take the path mentioned in the film, will end up in the same situation as the girl depicted in the movie.

Overall, Sudipto Sen has done an amazing job. The film feels like its almost taken out from a Documentary shot in Syria or Afghanistan. The actors were brilliant especially Adah Sharma, who has done a terrific job and if I may say so, put her ""HEAD"" on the line to make this movie a success. So she deserves all the applause.

Finally, I would like to say that movies are made and released almost every week. But to make a movie like this which shows hardcore facts and throws these facts on the face of those people who are in denial of such obnoxious truths that is happening not only in Kerala, but also in developed countries like US and UK, is praise-worthy and requires some serious balls which Sudipto has proven he has.",,5 May 2023,10/10

moviebluffhere,"Kerala Story must be lauded not because it's an exceptional piece of cinema - or that it subverts some conventions in filmmaking. In fact, on the technical front, it is mediocre at best BUT it is brave attempt to showcase, and perhaps start a conversation about the cultural programming against a community and their religion. It succeeds in capturing the potential of radicalism in Islam, it's dangerous insistence on being non-accepting of other religions, and most importantly it's violent canvassing for the name of ""Allah"" at the cost of subjecting others to absolute cruelty.

It also presents, though a messy, picture of the politics at play. But as was previously mentioned, the movie needs to be lauded because it is unapologetic and thankfully not politically correct. The angst, the contained pain is visible.

Adah Sharma is very convincing in her role, and so are the other two new comers. The music is a little off putting but overall, being an important film it must be watched at least once. Perhaps, it's one of the earlier movies that are going to deal with this subject in a more mature manner. But I'm not going to deduct stars for that.

lakshmishaks88,"""The Kerala Story"" is a compelling and thought-provoking film that sheds light on a subject that has remained untold for far too long. Inspired by true incidents, the movie follows the journey of Shalini Unnikrishnan, played brilliantly by Adah Sharma, as she navigates a dangerous world.

Director Sen employs a shock-and-awe approach, similar to ""The Kashmir Files,"" which adds to the film's compelling nature. The visuals are powerful from the start, with Shalini portrayed as a trapped and manipulated victim. Adah Sharma delivers a bold performance, capturing the essence of her character and bringing attention to the challenges faced by individuals in similar situations.

The plot revolves around Shalini, a student who moves to Kasargod to pursue her studies. There, she encounters three roommates from different backgrounds, setting the stage for intense discussions and exploration of diverse ideologies. These thought-provoking debates raise questions about faith and add depth to the narrative.

As the story unfolds, Shalini faces orchestrated social situations designed to exploit her vulnerability. The film delves into the tactics used by manipulative individuals, shedding light on the methods employed to exert control and influence. Sen provides valuable insight into the complexities of manipulation and radicalization.

Adah Sharma and the supporting cast deliver commendable performances, portraying their characters with authenticity and emotional depth. Their portrayal adds credibility to the narrative, capturing the struggles faced by victims and evoking empathy from the audience.

""The Kerala Story"" also addresses the need for broader conversations about individual freedoms and the protection of human rights. It prompts viewers to reflect on societal norms and the importance of understanding diverse perspectives.

The post-credits scene is particularly moving, as the film includes testimonials from real-life victims' families. This raw and emotional footage serves as a reminder of the real-world impact of extremism and the pain endured by those affected. It leaves a lasting impact on the audience.

While the storyboarding could benefit from further refinement, the filmmakers and crew deserve recognition for their courage in tackling a sensitive subject. By bringing awareness to the struggles faced by victims, they shed light on an important issue that demands attention.

""The Kerala Story"" is a film that should be seen by many, as it brings awareness to the challenges and experiences of victims. It encourages viewers to consider the power of manipulation and serves as a reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding.",,10 May 2023,9/10
sameerlodaya,"Sameer lodaya

The movie emphasised too much on the cross borders of Islamic countries rather than the main content of brain washing and converting to other religion

The content is very tough and is hard to accept the pain of these girls who were influenced to change their minds ,thoughts and religions by a group of separatists

Adah gave a fabulous performance from innocent to militant with good support from other fellow actors

Some scenes were too harsh and were not easy to digest only if you are mentally strong then only go for this movie..the pain has been elongated too much

Some negatives like the pace of the movie is slow in first half..too much of I'll treat was shown on women of other countries which was not required..showing the travel to countries in illegal ways was out of context

I still find the trailer was nerve breaking rather then the movie.",,5 May 2023,6/10
doobaara,"Top notch performance, great story, cinematography and direction !! Must watch. The story is setup in kerela but moves to Afganistan and middle East. The character are grounded to reality and are exaggerated. One of the few movies where the movies is better than the trailer ..10/10 to lead actors and the director for dealing with such sensetive subject. The heart of the movie is in right place and once your start watch you can relate to the actors. Don't go out with any prejudice and look for the human side of the story. Also the movie background score is good. Kerela is god own country and the cinematography justify that !!",,8 May 2023,10/10
nadkarnisumeet,"The Kerala Story review :

Not as hard hitting and engaging as The Kashmir Files (2022), The Kerala Story is still a pertinent take on the religious conversions which we keep hearing in the news. The fact that these Hindu women were not just converted but also instigated to join the ISIS as sex slaves makes for a chilling and compelling watch.

The subtle manner in which the brain washing starts... and where it finally ends is accurately depicted in the movie. The desert locales have an authentic look and the performances from the entire cast, particularly Adah Sharma is first rate. Vipul Amrutlal Shah has touched a daringly realistic subject this time and done fair justice to it though the film has its share of flaws.

The background score jars at times. The Malayalam dialogues with sudden Hindi words in between don't work. And frankly, the easy peasy way in which the two nursing students get convinced by their conniving roommate to change their religion appears a tad too convenient from a writing perspective. The entire brain washing process needed more gravitas..

Having said that, The Kerala Story is a relevant piece of cinema. Such 'love jihad' incidents have indeed taken place and will continue until we have strict enforceable laws in place. This film will at least pose as a warning or a deterrant to the impressionable youngsters falling in to this vicious trap. Recommended stuff!!

siddharthgades,"The movie is a brilliant enactment of the situation that has befallen the south indian state better known as gods own country.

If you are a fan of movies that narrate a story that is rich on heart and emotional context you will like this as the fact is that hundreds of such cases have come in to light where the bride to order and brain washing conversion and forced inclusion to ISIS into becoming the sex slaves of the savage religious fanatics was prevalent during the peak of ISIS recruitment drive.

The film brilliantly showcases the systematic breakdown of each important part of the conversion and supply protocol as much as the Mardaani sequence of human trafficking racket.",,6 May 2023,10/10
rajabhaipro,"Heart-wrenching portrayal of the brutal reality that Hindu girls have faced at the hands of extremists who use religion as a tool to spread terror. The performances of the actors were excellent, and the direction was spot-on, making it a compelling watch. However, I must warn viewers that some scenes may be disturbing and difficult to watch. Overall, the movie sheds light on an issue that needs to be addressed and stopped. No girl, regardless of her religion, should be forcefully converted or subjected to any form of violence or terror. It is a must-watch for anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of the horrors that some people have faced in the name of religion.",,6 May 2023,10/10

Thank God, finally this movie came out. Lots of young boys and girls will be saved now. We need more such movies to aware young girls in other parts of India. My heart goes to the victims and their family members. More power to the movie creators who brought this truth out amongst the public.

This movie shows how ISIS and radical people lure gullible girls in the name of so-called love and the atrocities that they had to go through. It's a must-watch movie for every Indian if they care about women. The performances and the direction of the movie are on point.

This movie is an eye opener for all apologists who think only one side needs to believe any truth that is fed to them. The shock factor in this movie was absolutely necessary and it brought out the pain of thousands of women who have been brainwashed to go through the conversion hell and is still happening in different parts of the country, not just Kerala. The entire process of how Hindu and Christian women are targeted and then systematically made to hate their own religion and beliefs, so that they can be converted, is shown without any censorship. This movie also portrays how important it is for parents to teach their kids about the right things before it's too late.",,12 May 2023,10/10
anjanashrestha2,"The moment I heard about this movie, I wanted to watch it. I did not have much expectations wrt the direction and the execution of the movie considering the challenging nature of the subject matter. So, I went to watch it ready to accept its subpar performance.

The movie was as expected. The cinematography of the deserts of Afghanistan was very beautiful. The depiction of the people and the culture shown was convincing to me (I haven't done any fact-checking but going with what the movie shows). Credit goes to the individual who conceptualized and captured those locations.

By watching the movie, yes, you understand how the so-called naïve girls are radicalized. However, the radicalization part has been a bit overdone and emphasized a bit more. It lacked the subtleties and the nuances but as I mentioned before, I was expecting that by the look of the trailers. That over-emphasis part can be paralleled with the movie ""3 idiots"" where the characters overplay to explain a point. It looks like the movie makers want to make sure that everyone understood the message loud and clear.

Having said that, the performance from the characters seemed a bit scripted, who otherewise looked talented. I should however commend on Adah Sharma's performance. Given the movies I watched of her (Haseen to Phaseen and Commando 2 or 3), I think this movie gave her a big break. It may even nominate her for the best performance (female) in the movie awards next year. (In fact, the movie itself may earn a couple of nominations.) She may have missed some nuances here and there but that is forgivable, at least to me, given that she still executed the tough role with such determination and courage. Kudos to her!

I am happy that the movie did well. If movies like Pathaan can break the box office, I really think The Kerala Story definitely deserves a chance. It has touched upon such an important issue. Once again, I don't know the facts but given that this is based on a true story, it reflects the ugly truths of the society. It at least makes people think, create an awareness and have them digging for facts. I would any day go and watch and support movies like these than going for Pathaan or like movies. I am not trying to say they are not good or entertaining but I am not drawn to movies that attract people solely by the virtue of big stars, bodies and glamour.

TKS is a movie that is very different and probably the first one in Hindi language (not sure about others) that has been made in the topic. Kudos to the movie makers for making that and for making us think.",,13 May 2023,7/10

Cinematography is the thing which will disappoint you and after all film is not marketed for its cinematography, and for a small budget film this is still impressive.

Accuracy: Although the story is about terriorism but still many at many instances it feels tooo.. exaggerated, like for where are the sources.

Whether the movie is a true story or not but still this movie doesn't disappoint you to know about Love Jihad unlike Toofaan who justifies it. Adah Sharma's acting was perfect. The movie have flaws too. It focuses too much on Adah Sharma not the other two girls. The Screenplay is too loose and the climax could be better than that.

sujan854,"The story is good and i think its brave for the director and writer to make a movie about this. But why didn't they try to get better actors for the movie? You can see bad acting from the beginning. The main character Shalini did fine, but those three people taking her interrogation didn't show any expression. They were like reading their lines. This happens for most of the characters. Director should have guided them better. Except for shalini's mother, shalini and her christian friend, none of the actors were even okayish. They were so bad.

Background score made me cringe so many times. Almost every time a muslim girl or any other muslim talks, there is a villain music, even when they are having normal convo. This movie goes too much against muslim.

In the hands of the better moviemaker, this movie could have been great. I don't mind it being controversial because the story is about something that happened in real life. So, there is no problem in subject matter. But the director should go to a film school and hire a better casting director. I still admire him for what he has tried but come on, this is not the way to tell such a serious story.

One more thing, what's up with the subtitles? Can hardly even read them. Even before the dialogue ends, the subtitles of that dialogue goes away. Also, let the scene play out for a while, you don't need to cut it out so quickly.",,20 May 2023,1/10
Vashista-Bhat,"The Kerala Story is one of the Outstanding movie this year. Script is based on the real-life story. Adah Sharma has performed well, and so have the other actors.

The way in which characters are developed in The Kerala Story is very good. Even the editing is good, and cinematography from Prasantu Mohapatra is very good.

boystarx-619-276074,"Watched #TheKeralaStory

Simply, a well made movie and good to watch watch in theaters. I had thought, it probably would be a bit cringe worthy to portray it's point but it was'nt.

The movie keeps the audience glued all along and doesn't drag anything. Gets to the point carefully and truthfully. Some scenes can make your eyes wet without over doing on anything. Does remind me of The Kashmir Files and it's careful approach to not get into religious debates and controversies. But the movie making approach is different from TKF. It does opens up the dark truths that have been brushed under the carpet in India but one can relate immediately based on such news that we have read earlier.

Direction is very good, it doesn't let you down and keeps you engaged without one coming out of the zone. It could have been better to Hollywood standards but that's something every Indian movie can be accused of.

Screenplay too is good, its simpler than TKF and mostly linear, keeping Indian audiences in mind. But it does it's job and doesn't drags or make you feel spoon fed at all.

Acting is awesome, every actor has done well in the limited space that they were given. But Adah Sharma steels the show, she amazes you with her acting. She proves, she is totally not a rookie for her debut performance(I guess). Kangana Ranaut would be proud of her acting for sure, that's how good she was.

Makeup and Costume, usually we dont talk about this aspect but makeup and costume work is so good that it simply stands out and gets noticed. Only in few movies you can see this aspect. The initial scene, notice the skin on her face or the condition of her hand, it feels so real. Notice the intricacies in dresses based on location and one scene where she gets ready to flee.

Surprisingly, a couple of background songs are too good, it comes without interrupting the movie and well placed. The lyrics and arrangement are both worth appreciating. The background score is also well in tune with the movie.

This movie also subtly touches issues happening in other parts of the world, indicatively, guess openly would have been better. Some scenes are not good to watch with conservative elders or children but the pain is universal and relatable for everyone.

At the end, there are real testimonies, proving to you that you didn't waste your money and emotion into some false narrative and the issue is real and horrific. Most people were teary eyed at the end, including me. Kudos to the courage of producers to pick this issue, make a film and put the pain of unspoken people in limelight. Hope this movie brings a positive change and no other girl or man gets trapped on something that is draconian to say the least. Do go and watch the movie.",,6 May 2023,10/10

kanishka-428-568356,"Given so many reviews are already out - here's a different take! :)

If there is one aspect where this movies seems unprecedented - it is the boldness of the topic and the blunt, yet balanced handling. Its hard to believe such a movie was conceived, produced and tasted such success in a country which used to on the forefront to ban books and any material deemed sensitive to a community!

So does the movie target a community? Not really. The makers have taken a real problem e.g. Radicalisation to convey their point. But what's the real point?

Perhaps, the real point is about one's inherent inability to deal with such meticulously planned devious attacks. If there is one point common in all the protagonists, none of them seem to had any trusted support group. The generation gap causing limited communication with the parents. So the protagonists are like a groups of deers under attack by a pride of lions. A group of confused and ill-prepared teen-adults. And one of the attackers is with them round the clock. Think a bit about it. Its a deadly combination. The targets don't stand much of a chance. And that's where the controversy lies. A full proof plan where the girl leaves for another country and then goes incommunicado. The only way to find the correct no may be to open a hotline and request people to share information. So the actual no is probably never going to come out.

Is the problem still present? If yes, this is perhaps the best thing to do. Spread awareness! And that's what makes it a must watch!",,13 May 2023,10/10
AlphaRomeoKilo,"""Kerala Story"" is a powerful movie that sheds light on the harsh realities of life in Kerala, India. The movie is based on true incidents and depicts the struggles of a young girl who is forced to work as a domestic worker to support her family. The movie showcases the stark differences between the rich and poor in Kerala and the exploitation that takes place in the name of domestic work.

The acting in the movie is outstanding and the cast has done a commendable job in portraying the complex emotions of the characters. The lead actress delivers a standout performance as the young girl who is forced to grow up too quickly and shoulder the burden of her family's financial woes. Her portrayal of the character's struggles and determination is truly inspiring and heart-wrenching.

The hard-hitting facts presented in the movie are eye-opening and shed light on the dark underbelly of Kerala society. The movie shows how the system has failed to protect the rights of the poor and how they are often exploited by the wealthy. The movie also highlights the role of the media and how it can be used to expose injustice and bring about change.

The cinematography and direction of the movie are also worth mentioning. The director has done a brilliant job in bringing the story to life and capturing the beauty of Kerala on camera. The movie's score is also noteworthy, adding to the emotional impact of the story.

Overall, ""Kerala Story"" is a must-watch for anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of the social issues that plague Kerala society. The movie is a powerful reminder that there is still a long way to go in terms of achieving social justice and equality for all. The movie is a testament to the power of cinema in raising awareness and inspiring change.",,9 May 2023,10/10

aanand_ub,"Pace and immersiveness

In the initial 20 minutes or so the performances and story line looked very typical, predictable and plastic. However I did not notice when I lost myself into the plot and storyline. The pace of the movie was quick which could be the reason why the movie could hold interest throughout its running time.

Acting and screen time

The lead role have been been played exceptionally well. The cast selected for different roles were well looking and with easily recognizable facial features and personalities. It was really a tricky task to make multiple ideologies of numerous characters easily identifiable. The plight and condition of parents could have been more. I felt that the amount of screen time and dialogues delivered by parents should have been more, even if that had added 5 more minutes to an already long movie. In reality the parents suffer as much as the children and their voices should have been portrayed more. Overall, every character has played the role well.

Sets and Picturization

The cinematography is just beautiful and breathtaking. At times I wondered if I should celebrate the scenery or lament upon the sensitivity of the situation. It makes me wonder how much detailing was done to make the sets, makeup and costume appear and match so realistically with intended spots. I felt that in few of the introductory scenes rendition of traditional Kerala culture and costumes was stereotypical. But I am not sure if such culture and costume are prominently visible in real life there as I have never visited Kerala. The editing could have been done better if there has not been any kind of censorship or public reaction. It really appears on few occasions that some editing was done under external pressure.

Dialogues and Music

The dialogues were perfectly written and delivered. The music gave goosebumps. The arguments given by one of the leading characters were uncannily similar to the arguments presented by guests and callers in Ex-Muslim streams on youtube. I wonder how the production team found out about the precise rhetoric used in real life for brain washing. The lead role must have practiced hard to get the perfect Hindi accent of Kerala people.

Facts and fiction

The factual and fictional content of the movie can be said to be 50-50. The final mental state of the lead character in the movie and the metal state of real life victims in their video interviews is just the opposite! The sequence of incidents, the way passports are switched from real to fake to avoid tracks of traveling to middle east and the ultimate destiny of victims has been shown correctly. The suffering and torture suffered by sex slaves has been quite diluted. The amount of violence show is heavily diluted as compared to real life footages, but it is still slightly more than what a common person can tolerate.

Coverage of the Issue

The movies covers almost all doctrines of taqiyya, kitman, tawriay, taysir, darura and marura by depicting the techniques of affair, assault, drugs, desertation, extortion, emotional exploitation and above all fear and greed. The methods used by scammers are precise and require training. The points on which I disagree with the movie is that the film shows 100% success rate of these traditional deceptive methods but we know in real life failure do happen and miss rates must be quite high. Some may find the story awkward or not so typical of an interesting movie, but real life is like that. People can be scammed in so many ways that the more you show the worse the story will become. Still, the movie succeeds in covering most of the typical methods with minimum damage to the main story.

Conclusion

Acting, dialoges, narration, picturization, music are good. The way some Hindu religious figures have been ridiculed might offend some Hindus, though nothing serious or offensive has been told or shown about any religion given that it is impossible to separate religion from the underlying phenomena in this kind of scam.",,7 May 2023,10/10

vivchopra,"""The Kerala Story"" is a powerful and thought-provoking film that delves deep into the captivating narrative of three young girls who become the targets of an ISIS sleeper cell in Kerala, India. The movie takes us on a harrowing journey as these girls are subjected to relentless attempts at brainwashing, aimed at converting them to Islam. What unfolds is a chilling depiction of the lengths to which these extremists will go to achieve their objectives, employing subtle techniques of manipulation and coercion.

The film shines a light on the unimaginable brutality faced by the girls once they are ensnared in the web of this extremist ideology. It unflinchingly portrays the physical abuses, atrocities, and even the sexual enslavement that awaits those who succumb to the pressure to convert. The impact of these experiences reverberates not only through the lives of the girls themselves but also through their families, who must grapple with the devastating aftermath of their loved ones' entanglement with ISIS.

What sets ""The Kerala Story"" apart is its foundation in real events. Through meticulous research, it becomes evident that this alarming phenomenon extends far beyond the borders of Kerala, resonating in various parts of India and the world. This realization adds a chilling sense of urgency to the film, urging viewers, particularly girls and parents, to remain informed, exercise caution, and prioritize their safety in the face of such dangers.

It is crucial to acknowledge that ""The Kerala Story"" offers a specific perspective on ISIS and its interpretation of Islam and Sharia law. It is not intended as a sweeping critique of Islam or Muslims in general. Rather, the film aims to shed light on the ideology propagated by ISIS and the perilous consequences it poses. By focusing on the actions and beliefs of this extremist group, the movie aims to ignite discussion and raise awareness about the dangers that lurk within society.

""The Kerala Story"" is a must-watch film that merits attention on a global scale. Its ability to captivate audiences while shedding light on a pressing issue is commendable. By weaving together a gripping narrative based on real events, the film educates viewers about the dangers of extremist ideologies and the importance of remaining vigilant. It serves as a clarion call to society to come together, engage in dialogue, and take proactive steps to safeguard the well-being and safety of individuals, especially vulnerable young girls.

In summary, ""The Kerala Story"" is a cinematic masterpiece that confronts audiences with the harsh realities faced by those ensnared in the clutches of extremist ideologies. It offers a poignant portrayal of resilience and serves as a catalyst for conversation and action. By watching this film, audiences are compelled to confront the pervasive threat of radicalization and unite in the pursuit of a safer and more secure future for all.",,17 May 2023,10/10
jay-techie2007,"Quite an intense movie. Well made, though it could have been better, especially when comparing it with The Kashmir Files, Kantara or Malikappuram.

But this is a must watch to understand how we, as parents, set up our kids for failure against proselytization when they don't know well enough about our belief system, culture and traditions. In extreme cases, like the one depicted in this movie, they are gobbled up into the world of global terrorism through gradual indoctrination. It shows our blindspots and how, not having kids rooted in our culture, can lead to them getting planted elsewhere.

Good casting with some solid performances. Adah Sharma takes the movie on her shoulders and does a good job of it. The story is well paced - broken into three parts - present, immediate past, and further past - keeping the audience hooked.

Definitely to be watched!",,21 May 2023,9/10
malviyachandan,"Both Storyline as well as Cinematic Masterpiece. Very artistically director has portrayed a very key issue through its artistic freedom. Used great Makeup artists, great actors and actresses.

Sudipto Sen deserves all the appreciation he is receiving for his excellent work as director.

Adah Sharma such a beautiful actress given her best till now made everyone fall in deep connect with that Character.

Director has used inspiration from a big issue and portrayed it in very meaningful way. Everyone is finding themselves to able to connect with story, by watching that movie you'll get that feeling that this movie crosses your lives also in some way.",,20 May 2023,10/10
priyaranjansamal-39765,"I was Shocked, and speechless after watching ""The Kerala Story"". While watching felt like I was not ready to watch such brutal truth.

Those who are saying this is propaganda by RSS, Kindly go and watch ""Caliphate- On NETFLIX (2020)"" a Swedish Webseries, based on the same concept, but in Sweden, there is no RSS or BJP, then why they made this?

If you ignore the fact of ""Love Zihad"", it will not change the reality, but yes one day it will affect your family and you will be alone that day.

'The Kerala Story' begins in the interrogation room where Shalini (Adah Sharma) is revealing details of her horrific and tragic past and the reason why she is in a situation of crisis. Her backstory revolves around four college students who have enrolled in a Nursing School in Kerala. It's a raw, gripping screenplay with excellent performances by all actors. The narrative is crisp and the director Sudipto Sen sir has done a fantastic job! Few scenes are too tough and very disturbing to watch!!

On a personal level and on a societal level it is very important for us to go back to our roots, know about our history and understand our Sanatan dharma.

This thought-provoking film is disturbing and surely manages to leave an impact. All adults please watch it and save your kids.

I will give it 9 out of 10.",,16 May 2023,10/10
GhostofIndia,"A film that explores the captivating landscapes of Kerala while delving into the dark realities of ISIS recruitment. And here's the exciting part - I invite you to watch this incredible movie and discover its thought-provoking narrative firsthand!

Now, why should you make ""The Kerala Story"" your next movie night pick? Well, it's not just a film; it's an immersive journey that will leave you spellbound. The filmmakers fearlessly shed light on the sensitive issue of radicalization in Kerala, making this an eye-opening and socially significant work of art.

I eagerly await more enriching movie experiences to discuss with you in the future.",,9 May 2023,10/10
bc_raghavendra-604-485763,"Since my native place is near to Mangalore, I know the incidents of the movie are true.

Whereas I am giving only 6 star to this movie because the script should have had more clarity on characters. For example, when the leading character Shalini was taken to SriLanka, she gets a call from her hostel friend who says that they all are trapped. But why didn't Shalini try to escape from SriLanka itself, since she realized about trap? Why did she kept on believing her husband till she reaches Afghanistan?

When Shalini gets cheated by her boy friend, then why did she listen to Maulvi instead of reaching to her mother?

There is no reasons shown in the movie for these.",,23 May 2023,6/10
amitkabra85,"Awesome movie with some hard hitting scenes. It was really moving during some scenes. Movies closer to harsh truth should be made more often. Everyone should watch this. I highly recommend it.

However they could have shown more of regressive culture and treatment of women. I do not kneoow the previous work of the director but movie was great. Much of the information is available on public domain. It was heart wrenching to see that none of the real culprits have been brought to the justice of law.

Adah sharma was superb in her accent and acting. Other actors too have done decent job. Go for it.",,12 May 2023,10/10
rahulharish-21865,"The movie has high production value and is better than 99% of the Bollywood movies out there. Amazing screenplay, so not a dull moment. The true story of how a girl in Kerala, pursuing a Masters degree away from home, is brainwashed by the radical community there, to turn against her family and her faith. She and other students are manipulated by a radical roommate and some male friends into sleazy relationships in the name of 'love'. Forced conversion follows with the tacit support of the community, which tears apart the homes of all 3 girls. They become prisoners of an age old desert cult, they barely understand and have no connection with. Cheated and then shipped off as slaves and baby factories to Syria and Afghanistan, will they reunite with their families? Watch to find out.",,5 May 2023,10/10
rohonnag,"Movies can entertain, they can invoke new ideas and sometimes they can bring about change. Change of thought process, change of perspective etc. This is a movie that changes your perception of the world we live in, especially if you don't know what sort of things are happening around us hidden in plain sight.

This is a movie which is difficult to watch. Not because it is not well made, but because it shows the stark-naked truth in such a simple and devastating manner. Things that happen to the women in this film which is based on real life incidents are not for the weak of stomach. But it's the reality we live in and most would find it convenient to ignore the truth rather than confront it.

As a film, the cinematography is good, the camera work is organic and not overly dramatic. There are some dramatic shots, but those are needed to set the tone of the film. The look and feel of the film seem more real than fictional. This movie feels very authentic in its tonality and stands apart from typical Bollywood films like Kabul Express, Fanaa or Kurbaan.

The narrative of the film is nonlinear. It follows roughly three different timelines of the same person. First one of her being in college, another of her in Afghanistan and the last one of her incarcerated at an UN detention camp. The scenes flow mostly seamlessly from one timeline to the other. Sometimes the shift in tonality from a happy and positive interaction in the past to a rather bleak and grim present is done intentionally to jar the audience and shake them from their slumber (figuratively speaking) of believing all is right in the world just because they can't see such things happening in front of them.

All the songs in the film are either used in montage scenes or in the background. There is no waste of time entertainment dance numbers or anything overtly filmi when it comes to the music. The background score is used sparingly but is effective.

Overall: As a film, this is a very tragic subject matter. It's hard to make it through the movie without some sort of emotional reaction, be it sadness, depression or sheer anger. The movie is meant to evoke such reactions. That's what showing the truth as plainly as possible does to the masses. So be warned, this is a film that is hard hitting and not a fun time pass sort of watch. Don't go in with a bunch of friends expecting to have a good time.

Go see it with friends and family to open their eyes on what is going on and what might happen to someone they know and love if we as a society don't hold the people doing such inhuman acts accountable for their actions. This is a film that every Indian needs to see. Its an absolute must watch.

Rating: 7.5/10.

Conclusion: There are no negatives as such in the film, but maybe due to censor board, scenes that are showing the conversion to radical thought process did feel a bit truncated. Some moments of the film could have lingered a tad bit more to hammer the point home. But those are minor gripes in an otherwise well-made film about a very tragic and intense subject matter.",,5 May 2023,8/10

Many real and eye opening truth which was not revealed hats off to director and actor who worked on and made this movie a masterpiece with blockbuster. I really keep this movie to show to my kids now they are too small but once they get maturity i will show them every year so that they don't forget and always learn.

munmoonghosh-48734,"This movie shows how women are recruited to be sent to IS. The whole journey is way too disturbing! But young girls must watch this movie so that they dont believe everything in the name of love.

Adah Sharma nailed the show!!! The background music could have been better though. The other supporting characters were bringing the best in Adah Sharma.

If you are looking for a masala movie then it is not your cup of tea. It is based on a very sensitive topic. It will make you uncomfortable.

The people in India act too sophisticated to not discuss what all is happening in the name of religion. We must make ourselves comfortable and stop fearing that we are judged if we speak the truth about the conversion games.",,6 May 2023,10/10

limitedwatersupplied,"'The Kerala Story' narrates the tales of three young girls from various regions of Kerala, with the primary focus on the story of Shalini, who is abducted and subsequently converted to Islam. Shalini is then radicalized. And compelled to join ISIS as a terrorist.

'The Kerala Story' is centered around the alleged radicalization and conversion of young Hindu women to Islam in Kerala, after which they are forced to join ISIS. The film states that it's a true story of three young girls from different parts of Kerala.

Riveting story telling method combined with great performances, tight screenplay and crisp editing made it a master piece. What's disturbing is that it's all happened really in the country.

I am NOT any ideology or party/AGENDA supporter, but I must say this is one of the best movies I have seen in recent times. It shows a very detailed situation of terrorism and it's strategic planning not only in war but in the terms of soft war and brainwashing people. Irrespective of the controversy whether the cases are 32000 or 3, one must understand that even if the case is only ONE still this is what the terrorist have agenda.

Besides the message I must say the acting is done very well by the characters. You will not be bored in the entire duration of the movie. Whether or not you think of this as agenda or truth do watch for the actors and storyline.",,6 May 2023,10/10

Also movie shows we are not teaching our kids about our religion, culture and roots and therefore they are not aligning with us instead they aling with others.

ashwinnagar,"The movie Kerala Story is a poignant and thought-provoking portrayal of the dangers and devastation wrought by ISIS terror, particularly in the Indian state of Kerala, which has a large Muslim population. The film sheds light on how ISIS recruits non-Muslim women from Kerala through deceitful means, and then puts them in harm's way on the battlefield, making their lives a living hell. It is a powerful wake-up call for the world to confront the evil designs of this terrorist organization.

Through its gripping narrative and powerful visuals, the movie exposes the insidious tactics used by ISIS to lure young non-Muslim girls, convert them to Islam, and then use them for their own nefarious purposes. The film highlights the stark reality of the situation and makes us aware of the urgent need to act against such heinous acts.

Overall, Kerala Story is a must-watch movie that provides a stark reminder of the dangers posed by terrorism and the need for vigilance against it.

vtmathewm,"I watched the movie after seeing positive reviews.

Sadly disappointed. As a Keralite it was pushing the limits of my intelligence and sense to watch the pathetic screenplay. Nursing students molested in a Mall in full public view, in Kerala?? No one reacts, not even mobile phone and online media warriors? Come on.

Nursing students seen taking pills given to them just as if it was the most normal thing to do. Even kids would be wary. Whoever wrote the screenplay needs to get a reality check.

A mother whose daughter is missing for long, gets a surprise call from her later from Afghanistan, and she has for her mushy dialogues, like how does it feel to be a mother.

I saw the Hindi version, for some inexplicable reason all actors speak Hindi with a Malayalam accent and Malyalam with a Hindi accent. You can't be both.

At the end, they say they have filed an RTI to verify their own claims of numbers. It's your own claim! You have to provide proof.

For me, it's Just a hype created by people.

I don't Care about what others say. The movie is just completely pointless. It feels unnatural.

Its not worth the hype for which people are going Crazy.

The movie claims to be inspired by real-life events, but it seems to be entirely baseless and lacks any real substance. The plot is all over the place, and it's difficult to understand what is happening. The characters are poorly developed, and their motivations are unclear. The dialogues are unconvincing.

Its only the Acting of the Talented Actors which doesn't feel unnatural and feels real.

Despite the movie's claims to be inspired by real-life events, there is no sense of realism or authenticity. The story seems to be fabricated to attract audiences, and the title seems to be a mere marketing ploy. The movie fails to deliver any real emotional impact or make a meaningful statement.

Adah Sharma was able to bring out the emotions and feelings of the audience as it was required from her as an actor. From the South Indian accent to some clap-worthy dialogues, Adah was a treat to watch on the big screen. Sudipto Sen majorly focused on three 'true stories', he did bring out his creative work by not just showing the dark elements but also giving refreshments to his audience by showing the beautiful views of Kerala, a South Indian household, and some college moments. Not only he focused on the plight of the three women but also on the pain that was inflicted on the families. Each woman's story was different from the other but yet connected by the same thread - Terrorism.

Anonymous_ly,"The movie stays to the point for the entire length, the effort to make it in such a way that a typical Indian woman can connect to her daily life, is evident. The parts that appear exaggeratingly violent are unfortunately, factually correct.

The only curse of the movie is that the people have a very rigid perception about the movie, the audience is highly polarized, those who'll watch will support & those who won't will oppose, in all this, the efforts to address an immediate need for a mass level awareness about mainstream beliefs of world's fastest growing religion, are compromised.

One area where it succeeds fully, is in conveying the sorrow of the women portrayed.

Several areas of improvement could be pointed out in terms of subtlety of story & script writing, but they would make the movie irrelevant for the Indian masses.

It'd be difficult for the movie to reach the audiences who need to: watch it / add another perspective to how they look at things.",,6 May 2023,8/10

rahulvadap,"The way the movie is shot, directed and the background music is fantastic, especially the Kurdish song at the end will leave you numb.

Full marks to Adah Sharma for acting and also to the Sonia Balani the girl who plays the role of Asifa. You will get angry seeing her on screen meaning she has done a fantastic job at potraying her character.

You dont feel you are watching the movie but a documentary.

Immense research has gone into the movie of 7 years. Director Sudipto Sen has spoken how he visited Kerala several times in past 7yrs to reseach on the subject and that research shows in the film.

Do not pay attention to the negative press and go watch the movie then do some basic research you will understand what's the reality.

Full marks of chosing the subject and bringing such a movie to light.",,5 May 2023,10/10
mypapa-04559,"This is in real sense called a movie. No hype, no over rated star casts of bollywood but BIG on the story line, a true story of many... These kind of movies takes arduous effort by the movie makers and each of their crew.

Since this movie was made after a few years of research about the horrendus situation of illegal religious conversion in the Indian state of Kerala (actually in most states of India and even in some parts of the world, for e.g. In the UK), it has justfied its aspect for which it has been made!

Can't stop praising about the skills of the actors in portraying their characters of the real incidents (even happening now) in India.

pirtaesking,"""The Converted"" appears to be a movie that tackles important and relevant themes related to religious extremism and terrorism. The story of Fatima Ba is likely to be an emotional and thought-provoking journey that sheds light on the power of manipulation and the dangers of religious fanaticism. The film has the potential to spark important discussions about the impact of terrorism on individuals and society, as well as the need to combat extremism in all its forms. However, it is difficult to assess the movie's execution or quality without having seen it. Overall, ""The Converted"" sounds like an important and timely film that has the potential to make a significant impact.

The movie features powerful performances from its ensemble cast, and the direction is skillful in building tension and suspense throughout the narrative. The film is well-researched and presents a controversial topic that raises important questions about politics, power, and human rights. However, some viewers may find the film's portrayal of certain individuals or groups to be biased or one-sided.

Any culture/civilization / society which fails to save their women from external predators is doomed to become extinct. Needless to say which culture / civilization and whose ethos are endangered.

krishtealovestealove-81469,"The Kerala Story is a movie that delves into the issue of alleged radicalization and forced conversion of young Hindu women to Islam in Kerala, after which they are coerced into joining ISIS. The movie is based on a true story of three young girls from different parts of Kerala, and the role of Shalini/Fatima is played by Adah Sharma, who delivers a powerful and emotionally stirring performance.

The director Sudipto Sen has chosen a sensitive and complex subject, and the treatment of the film is said to be difficult to watch with several disturbing scenes, moments and dialogues. However, some reviews suggest that the treatment gets increasingly guided more by local politics than cinematic sagacity. While the movie does have some poignant moments, for the most part, it is either the gullible girls eager to buy the propaganda or sly creatures with Muslim names; there is no voice of sanity, and nuance is nowhere to be found.

The movie also features the narration of a converted Muslim woman, Fatima Ba, who shares her story of being abducted from her home and manipulated by religious vanguards to become an ISIS terrorist, eventually landing her in an Afghanistan jail.

The Kerala Story is a movie that highlights a critical issue that is currently affecting many parts of the world, and it is commendable that the director has chosen to bring attention to this subject. The movie attempts to showcase the harrowing experiences of the young girls who are forced to convert and join ISIS, and the emotional toll that this takes on them and their families. Adah Sharma's performance as Shalini/Fatima is powerful, and she brings depth and nuance to her character.

However, as some reviews suggest, the movie could have delved deeper into the issue and provided more nuanced and balanced portrayals of the characters involved. While it is important to raise awareness about the issue of forced conversions and radicalization, it is also important to avoid stereotyping and demonizing entire communities, which can fuel existing biases and prejudices.

Overall, The Kerala Story is a movie that attempts to shine a light on a critical issue, and the performances of the actors, especially Adah Sharma, are noteworthy. However, the treatment of the film could have been more nuanced and balanced to provide a deeper understanding of the complex issues involved. It is a movie worth watching, but with the understanding that it portrays a highly sensitive subject that needs to be examined with care and caution.",,5 May 2023,10/10

nitsvirusboyz,"The Kerala Story is a hard-hitting, shocking, and disturbing film that leaves the viewers with a feeling of discomfort. The story of the film revolves around love-jihad, brutal inhuman crimes such as rape, sex slavery, radicalisation, indoctrination, and ISIS recruitment. Even if the shreds of evidence are lacking, the makers would like you to believe that these events are inspired by true incidents. If you still don't believe that then the victim and the parents of the victims speak at the end of the movie making it more believable.

The director and writers of the film managed to keep the story intriguing. The dialogues are powerful but few are manipulative and it tries to provoke hate. The first half is engaging, fast-paced, and quickly introduces us to three nursing students in Kerala who are brainwashed by an extremist group and makes them believe that only Islam can be their saviour. The screenplay in the second half is engrossing and keeps you hooked until the end of the film. The parallel storylines showing the past and present scenes are well-edited and well-balanced.

Adah Sharma delivers a praiseworthy performance and she has done complete justice to the character of vulnerable Shalini. Her Malayali accent is spot on. Yogita Bihani and Siddhi Idnani played their part very well. Sonia Balani's dialogue delivery and her performance as Asifa was excellent. Other supporting actors played their parts with utmost sincerity.

swaroopnagraj,"The film is an eye-opener. Every Indian should watch this no matter their religion or state. Because this movie shows the truth about Monotheistic Abrahamic religions which only believe in one God and completely reject people belonging to other faiths.

The movie shows the raw stories that happen in countries of the Middle-east, where ISIS and other terror organizations operate. The movie doesn't shy away from depicting blood and gore that is common to desert cultures and people.

People are saying that the makers of the movie lied and that they don't have any proof over the claims of 32,000 women from Kerala being took to Syria. But I would like to ask all of those people, that even if 1 girl has gone through such a blood-curdling experience, isn't this fact itself more than enough to make a movie about the girl's life and why she choose this path.

The purpose of the film is mainly to create awareness and prevent such things from happening in the future and the movie has done an amazing job in this regard. As the message is loud and clear, that anyone who has grand foolish dreams about the ""After-life"" and decides to take the path mentioned in the film, will end up in the same situation as the girl depicted in the movie.

Overall, Sudipto Sen has done an amazing job. The film feels like its almost taken out from a Documentary shot in Syria or Afghanistan. The actors were brilliant especially Adah Sharma, who has done a terrific job and if I may say so, put her ""HEAD"" on the line to make this movie a success. So she deserves all the applause.

Finally, I would like to say that movies are made and released almost every week. But to make a movie like this which shows hardcore facts and throws these facts on the face of those people who are in denial of such obnoxious truths that is happening not only in Kerala, but also in developed countries like US and UK, is praise-worthy and requires some serious balls which Sudipto has proven he has.",,5 May 2023,10/10

From our childhood we have been told to keep quiet on everything even if it's a wrong thing, they run fake propaganda agenda like PK and try to ban real events.

moviebluffhere,"Kerala Story must be lauded not because it's an exceptional piece of cinema - or that it subverts some conventions in filmmaking. In fact, on the technical front, it is mediocre at best BUT it is brave attempt to showcase, and perhaps start a conversation about the cultural programming against a community and their religion. It succeeds in capturing the potential of radicalism in Islam, it's dangerous insistence on being non-accepting of other religions, and most importantly it's violent canvassing for the name of ""Allah"" at the cost of subjecting others to absolute cruelty.

It also presents, though a messy, picture of the politics at play. But as was previously mentioned, the movie needs to be lauded because it is unapologetic and thankfully not politically correct. The angst, the contained pain is visible.

Adah Sharma is very convincing in her role, and so are the other two new comers. The music is a little off putting but overall, being an important film it must be watched at least once. Perhaps, it's one of the earlier movies that are going to deal with this subject in a more mature manner. But I'm not going to deduct stars for that.

lakshmishaks88,"""The Kerala Story"" is a compelling and thought-provoking film that sheds light on a subject that has remained untold for far too long. Inspired by true incidents, the movie follows the journey of Shalini Unnikrishnan, played brilliantly by Adah Sharma, as she navigates a dangerous world.

Director Sen employs a shock-and-awe approach, similar to ""The Kashmir Files,"" which adds to the film's compelling nature. The visuals are powerful from the start, with Shalini portrayed as a trapped and manipulated victim. Adah Sharma delivers a bold performance, capturing the essence of her character and bringing attention to the challenges faced by individuals in similar situations.

The plot revolves around Shalini, a student who moves to Kasargod to pursue her studies. There, she encounters three roommates from different backgrounds, setting the stage for intense discussions and exploration of diverse ideologies. These thought-provoking debates raise questions about faith and add depth to the narrative.

As the story unfolds, Shalini faces orchestrated social situations designed to exploit her vulnerability. The film delves into the tactics used by manipulative individuals, shedding light on the methods employed to exert control and influence. Sen provides valuable insight into the complexities of manipulation and radicalization.

Adah Sharma and the supporting cast deliver commendable performances, portraying their characters with authenticity and emotional depth. Their portrayal adds credibility to the narrative, capturing the struggles faced by victims and evoking empathy from the audience.

""The Kerala Story"" also addresses the need for broader conversations about individual freedoms and the protection of human rights. It prompts viewers to reflect on societal norms and the importance of understanding diverse perspectives.

The post-credits scene is particularly moving, as the film includes testimonials from real-life victims' families. This raw and emotional footage serves as a reminder of the real-world impact of extremism and the pain endured by those affected. It leaves a lasting impact on the audience.

While the storyboarding could benefit from further refinement, the filmmakers and crew deserve recognition for their courage in tackling a sensitive subject. By bringing awareness to the struggles faced by victims, they shed light on an important issue that demands attention.

""The Kerala Story"" is a film that should be seen by many, as it brings awareness to the challenges and experiences of victims. It encourages viewers to consider the power of manipulation and serves as a reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding.",,10 May 2023,9/10

The movie emphasised too much on the cross borders of Islamic countries rather than the main content of brain washing and converting to other religion

The content is very tough and is hard to accept the pain of these girls who were influenced to change their minds ,thoughts and religions by a group of separatists

Adah gave a fabulous performance from innocent to militant with good support from other fellow actors

Some scenes were too harsh and were not easy to digest only if you are mentally strong then only go for this movie..the pain has been elongated too much

nadkarnisumeet,"The Kerala Story review :

Not as hard hitting and engaging as The Kashmir Files (2022), The Kerala Story is still a pertinent take on the religious conversions which we keep hearing in the news. The fact that these Hindu women were not just converted but also instigated to join the ISIS as sex slaves makes for a chilling and compelling watch.

The subtle manner in which the brain washing starts... and where it finally ends is accurately depicted in the movie. The desert locales have an authentic look and the performances from the entire cast, particularly Adah Sharma is first rate. Vipul Amrutlal Shah has touched a daringly realistic subject this time and done fair justice to it though the film has its share of flaws.

The background score jars at times. The Malayalam dialogues with sudden Hindi words in between don't work. And frankly, the easy peasy way in which the two nursing students get convinced by their conniving roommate to change their religion appears a tad too convenient from a writing perspective. The entire brain washing process needed more gravitas..

Having said that, The Kerala Story is a relevant piece of cinema. Such 'love jihad' incidents have indeed taken place and will continue until we have strict enforceable laws in place. This film will at least pose as a warning or a deterrant to the impressionable youngsters falling in to this vicious trap. Recommended stuff!!

Adah Sharma's performance was a treat to watch as well as the supporting cast has done a fantastic job even though the editing is on point.10/10 for the Kerala story.👍,,5 May 2023,10/10
rahulvaidya055,"This movie is for all those people who live in their bubble and think everyone and everything is good in the world. This movie is an eye opener for all apologists who think only one side needs to believe any truth that is fed to them. The shock factor in this movie was absolutely necessary and it brought out the pain of thousands of women who have been brainwashed to go through the conversion hell and is still happening in different parts of the country, not just Kerala. The entire process of how Hindu and Christian women are targeted and then systematically made to hate their own religion and beliefs, so that they can be converted, is shown without any censorship. This movie also portrays how important it is for parents to teach their kids about the right things before it's too late.",,12 May 2023,10/10
anjanashrestha2,"The moment I heard about this movie, I wanted to watch it. I did not have much expectations wrt the direction and the execution of the movie considering the challenging nature of the subject matter. So, I went to watch it ready to accept its subpar performance.

The movie was as expected. The cinematography of the deserts of Afghanistan was very beautiful. The depiction of the people and the culture shown was convincing to me (I haven't done any fact-checking but going with what the movie shows). Credit goes to the individual who conceptualized and captured those locations.

By watching the movie, yes, you understand how the so-called naïve girls are radicalized. However, the radicalization part has been a bit overdone and emphasized a bit more. It lacked the subtleties and the nuances but as I mentioned before, I was expecting that by the look of the trailers. That over-emphasis part can be paralleled with the movie ""3 idiots"" where the characters overplay to explain a point. It looks like the movie makers want to make sure that everyone understood the message loud and clear.

Having said that, the performance from the characters seemed a bit scripted, who otherewise looked talented. I should however commend on Adah Sharma's performance. Given the movies I watched of her (Haseen to Phaseen and Commando 2 or 3), I think this movie gave her a big break. It may even nominate her for the best performance (female) in the movie awards next year. (In fact, the movie itself may earn a couple of nominations.) She may have missed some nuances here and there but that is forgivable, at least to me, given that she still executed the tough role with such determination and courage. Kudos to her!

I am happy that the movie did well. If movies like Pathaan can break the box office, I really think The Kerala Story definitely deserves a chance. It has touched upon such an important issue. Once again, I don't know the facts but given that this is based on a true story, it reflects the ugly truths of the society. It at least makes people think, create an awareness and have them digging for facts. I would any day go and watch and support movies like these than going for Pathaan or like movies. I am not trying to say they are not good or entertaining but I am not drawn to movies that attract people solely by the virtue of big stars, bodies and glamour.

TKS is a movie that is very different and probably the first one in Hindi language (not sure about others) that has been made in the topic. Kudos to the movie makers for making that and for making us think.",,13 May 2023,7/10
erdzenforpublic,"Alert : Review based on film Not Story This movie is not for my type of neutral audience, as if want to spend for some cinematic experience.

Cinematography is the thing which will disappoint you and after all film is not marketed for its cinematography, and for a small budget film this is still impressive.

Let's talk about storytelling it is better I will not say best as there are still many flaws in that but not so boring.

Accuracy: Although the story is about terriorism but still many at many instances it feels tooo.. exaggerated, like for where are the sources.

So after all If you just an neutral I will suggest to go for guardian of the galaxy. And if you want to see this movie for what it has been marketed then please go.",,5 May 2023,1/10

All the location of this movie is very good each and every actor given 200% for this movie.

Ada Sharma doing great job.

You will never feel bore in the movie. The timing of every scene and song picturise perfectly.

Some more features can be added in this movie like Halala and Triple Talak director has the space for it but he avoided this issues.

samujjwalchowdhury,"The movie shows the true side of Love Jihad. How Hindu girls are trapped and brainwashed to convert into Islam. Whether the movie is a true story or not but still this movie doesn't disappoint you to know about Love Jihad unlike Toofaan who justifies it. Adah Sharma's acting was perfect. The movie have flaws too. It focuses too much on Adah Sharma not the other two girls. The Screenplay is too loose and the climax could be better than that. Asifa's character requires more screen presence. Rest I will recommend all the Hindu girls to watch this masterpiece. And the people who are calling it Islamophobic, the film potray ISIS in a negative light not Islam.",,6 May 2023,10/10
sujan854,"The story is good and i think its brave for the director and writer to make a movie about this. But why didn't they try to get better actors for the movie? You can see bad acting from the beginning. The main character Shalini did fine, but those three people taking her interrogation didn't show any expression. They were like reading their lines. This happens for most of the characters. Director should have guided them better. Except for shalini's mother, shalini and her christian friend, none of the actors were even okayish. They were so bad.

Background score made me cringe so many times. Almost every time a muslim girl or any other muslim talks, there is a villain music, even when they are having normal convo. This movie goes too much against muslim.

In the hands of the better moviemaker, this movie could have been great. I don't mind it being controversial because the story is about something that happened in real life. So, there is no problem in subject matter. But the director should go to a film school and hire a better casting director. I still admire him for what he has tried but come on, this is not the way to tell such a serious story.

One more thing, what's up with the subtitles? Can hardly even read them. Even before the dialogue ends, the subtitles of that dialogue goes away. Also, let the scene play out for a while, you don't need to cut it out so quickly.",,20 May 2023,1/10

Simply, a well made movie and good to watch watch in theaters. I had thought, it probably would be a bit cringe worthy to portray it's point but it was'nt.

The movie keeps the audience glued all along and doesn't drag anything. Gets to the point carefully and truthfully. Some scenes can make your eyes wet without over doing on anything. Does remind me of The Kashmir Files and it's careful approach to not get into religious debates and controversies. But the movie making approach is different from TKF. It does opens up the dark truths that have been brushed under the carpet in India but one can relate immediately based on such news that we have read earlier.

Direction is very good, it doesn't let you down and keeps you engaged without one coming out of the zone. It could have been better to Hollywood standards but that's something every Indian movie can be accused of.

Screenplay too is good, its simpler than TKF and mostly linear, keeping Indian audiences in mind. But it does it's job and doesn't drags or make you feel spoon fed at all.

Acting is awesome, every actor has done well in the limited space that they were given. But Adah Sharma steels the show, she amazes you with her acting. She proves, she is totally not a rookie for her debut performance(I guess). Kangana Ranaut would be proud of her acting for sure, that's how good she was.

Makeup and Costume, usually we dont talk about this aspect but makeup and costume work is so good that it simply stands out and gets noticed. Only in few movies you can see this aspect. The initial scene, notice the skin on her face or the condition of her hand, it feels so real. Notice the intricacies in dresses based on location and one scene where she gets ready to flee.

Surprisingly, a couple of background songs are too good, it comes without interrupting the movie and well placed. The lyrics and arrangement are both worth appreciating. The background score is also well in tune with the movie.

This movie also subtly touches issues happening in other parts of the world, indicatively, guess openly would have been better. Some scenes are not good to watch with conservative elders or children but the pain is universal and relatable for everyone.

At the end, there are real testimonies, proving to you that you didn't waste your money and emotion into some false narrative and the issue is real and horrific. Most people were teary eyed at the end, including me. Kudos to the courage of producers to pick this issue, make a film and put the pain of unspoken people in limelight. Hope this movie brings a positive change and no other girl or man gets trapped on something that is draconian to say the least. Do go and watch the movie.",,6 May 2023,10/10
free_pretender-81115,"The most powerful film on Conversion I have seen till now. It clearly portrays how innocent girls are trapped, converted, and used for ulterior motives. The movie touches the sensitive issue of LJ very profoundly and explains the plight of girls bitten by it. Hard-hitting, blunt, brutally honest. The acting by all characters even though not known very widely - positive and gray shades - have been able to bring characters to life. You get connected with the movie as you watch it further.

My mind is still stuck in the character of Nimha the young girl who successfully defended conversation but still couldn't save herself from those predators. Its like once you are at their gun point literally no one can save you, not your family, not even the law of land will protect you.

The film may have shown very simple way the trap being used but it is actually happening, if the girls support to go out of India, they lose their identity and future life. If they don't support to go out then they are killed. This all is happening in name of LOVE JIHAD.

The movie has received both negative and positive comments.

Personally, I liked it more as I am aware of the facts going on in India. And they are surely having funds to distribute so as they can do brainwash and all what is possible to just catch the teenagers in trap.

Hopefully more movies are made in future so that people come to know the reality. Adah Sharma has acted very well and the movie seems quite disturbing.

kanishka-428-568356,"Given so many reviews are already out - here's a different take! :)

If there is one aspect where this movies seems unprecedented - it is the boldness of the topic and the blunt, yet balanced handling. Its hard to believe such a movie was conceived, produced and tasted such success in a country which used to on the forefront to ban books and any material deemed sensitive to a community!

So does the movie target a community? Not really. The makers have taken a real problem e.g. Radicalisation to convey their point. But what's the real point?

Perhaps, the real point is about one's inherent inability to deal with such meticulously planned devious attacks. If there is one point common in all the protagonists, none of them seem to had any trusted support group. The generation gap causing limited communication with the parents. So the protagonists are like a groups of deers under attack by a pride of lions. A group of confused and ill-prepared teen-adults. And one of the attackers is with them round the clock. Think a bit about it. Its a deadly combination. The targets don't stand much of a chance. And that's where the controversy lies. A full proof plan where the girl leaves for another country and then goes incommunicado. The only way to find the correct no may be to open a hotline and request people to share information. So the actual no is probably never going to come out.

Is the problem still present? If yes, this is perhaps the best thing to do. Spread awareness! And that's what makes it a must watch!",,13 May 2023,10/10
AlphaRomeoKilo,"""Kerala Story"" is a powerful movie that sheds light on the harsh realities of life in Kerala, India. The movie is based on true incidents and depicts the struggles of a young girl who is forced to work as a domestic worker to support her family. The movie showcases the stark differences between the rich and poor in Kerala and the exploitation that takes place in the name of domestic work.

The acting in the movie is outstanding and the cast has done a commendable job in portraying the complex emotions of the characters. The lead actress delivers a standout performance as the young girl who is forced to grow up too quickly and shoulder the burden of her family's financial woes. Her portrayal of the character's struggles and determination is truly inspiring and heart-wrenching.

The hard-hitting facts presented in the movie are eye-opening and shed light on the dark underbelly of Kerala society. The movie shows how the system has failed to protect the rights of the poor and how they are often exploited by the wealthy. The movie also highlights the role of the media and how it can be used to expose injustice and bring about change.

The cinematography and direction of the movie are also worth mentioning. The director has done a brilliant job in bringing the story to life and capturing the beauty of Kerala on camera. The movie's score is also noteworthy, adding to the emotional impact of the story.

Overall, ""Kerala Story"" is a must-watch for anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of the social issues that plague Kerala society. The movie is a powerful reminder that there is still a long way to go in terms of achieving social justice and equality for all. The movie is a testament to the power of cinema in raising awareness and inspiring change.",,9 May 2023,10/10

The storytelling and the drama is spot on, the production by Vipul Amrutlal Shah was excellent, cinematography is top notch, music and other technical departments are also well done.

aanand_ub,"Pace and immersiveness

In the initial 20 minutes or so the performances and story line looked very typical, predictable and plastic. However I did not notice when I lost myself into the plot and storyline. The pace of the movie was quick which could be the reason why the movie could hold interest throughout its running time.

Acting and screen time

The lead role have been been played exceptionally well. The cast selected for different roles were well looking and with easily recognizable facial features and personalities. It was really a tricky task to make multiple ideologies of numerous characters easily identifiable. The plight and condition of parents could have been more. I felt that the amount of screen time and dialogues delivered by parents should have been more, even if that had added 5 more minutes to an already long movie. In reality the parents suffer as much as the children and their voices should have been portrayed more. Overall, every character has played the role well.

Sets and Picturization

The cinematography is just beautiful and breathtaking. At times I wondered if I should celebrate the scenery or lament upon the sensitivity of the situation. It makes me wonder how much detailing was done to make the sets, makeup and costume appear and match so realistically with intended spots. I felt that in few of the introductory scenes rendition of traditional Kerala culture and costumes was stereotypical. But I am not sure if such culture and costume are prominently visible in real life there as I have never visited Kerala. The editing could have been done better if there has not been any kind of censorship or public reaction. It really appears on few occasions that some editing was done under external pressure.

Dialogues and Music

The dialogues were perfectly written and delivered. The music gave goosebumps. The arguments given by one of the leading characters were uncannily similar to the arguments presented by guests and callers in Ex-Muslim streams on youtube. I wonder how the production team found out about the precise rhetoric used in real life for brain washing. The lead role must have practiced hard to get the perfect Hindi accent of Kerala people.

Facts and fiction

The factual and fictional content of the movie can be said to be 50-50. The final mental state of the lead character in the movie and the metal state of real life victims in their video interviews is just the opposite! The sequence of incidents, the way passports are switched from real to fake to avoid tracks of traveling to middle east and the ultimate destiny of victims has been shown correctly. The suffering and torture suffered by sex slaves has been quite diluted. The amount of violence show is heavily diluted as compared to real life footages, but it is still slightly more than what a common person can tolerate.

Coverage of the Issue

The movies covers almost all doctrines of taqiyya, kitman, tawriay, taysir, darura and marura by depicting the techniques of affair, assault, drugs, desertation, extortion, emotional exploitation and above all fear and greed. The methods used by scammers are precise and require training. The points on which I disagree with the movie is that the film shows 100% success rate of these traditional deceptive methods but we know in real life failure do happen and miss rates must be quite high. Some may find the story awkward or not so typical of an interesting movie, but real life is like that. People can be scammed in so many ways that the more you show the worse the story will become. Still, the movie succeeds in covering most of the typical methods with minimum damage to the main story.

Conclusion

Acting, dialoges, narration, picturization, music are good. The way some Hindu religious figures have been ridiculed might offend some Hindus, though nothing serious or offensive has been told or shown about any religion given that it is impossible to separate religion from the underlying phenomena in this kind of scam.",,7 May 2023,10/10

But this is a must watch to understand how we, as parents, set up our kids for failure against proselytization when they don't know well enough about our belief system, culture and traditions. In extreme cases, like the one depicted in this movie, they are gobbled up into the world of global terrorism through gradual indoctrination. It shows our blindspots and how, not having kids rooted in our culture, can lead to them getting planted elsewhere.

Good casting with some solid performances. Adah Sharma takes the movie on her shoulders and does a good job of it. The story is well paced - broken into three parts - present, immediate past, and further past - keeping the audience hooked.

Whereas I am giving only 6 star to this movie because the script should have had more clarity on characters. For example, when the leading character Shalini was taken to SriLanka, she gets a call from her hostel friend who says that they all are trapped. But why didn't Shalini try to escape from SriLanka itself, since she realized about trap? Why did she kept on believing her husband till she reaches Afghanistan?

With such an intense subject, he could have made the movie look more raw and natural. Instead, the director chose to downplay it and made it look like a documentary. The movie has some really good technical values. Camera work was convincing and editing was crisp. There are couple of songs which added some depth to the narrative. But the background score was a let down.

moviebluffhere,"Kerala Story (2023) must be lauded not because it is an exceptional piece of cinema - or that it subverts some conventions in filmmaking. In fact, on the technical front, it is mediocre at best but it is bold attempt to showcase, and perhaps start a conversation about the cultural programming against a community and their religion. It succeeds in capturing the potential of radicalism in Islam, its dangerous insistence on being non-accepting of other religions, and most importantly its violent canvassing for the name of ""Allah"" at the cost of subjecting others to absolute cruelty.

It also presents, though a messy, picture of the politics at play. But as was previously mentioned, the movie needs to be lauded because it is unapologetic and thankfully not politically correct. The angst, the contained pain is visible.

Adah Sharma is very convincing in her role, and so are the other two new comers. Being an important film it must be watched at least once. Perhaps, it is one of the earlier movies that are going to deal with this subject in a more mature manner. But I am not going to deduct stars for that. I couldn't have expected a masterpiece especially when there is so much of establishment hellbent on stalling the movie's release. It all makes sense why. The movie stirs some questions for sure - and also forces one to think why a movie like this needs to be stopped from releasing when everyone one way or the other is seeing this happen everyday. Perhaps, the filmmaker's lack of political correctness disturbs some.

Also, the movie features some really disturbing sequences of sexual assault and violence. Though the visceral impact is not as intense as The Kashmir Files (2022), it might be traumatising for some viewers.",,7 May 2023,Pas de note

mandarsawant-14413,"The film depicts true story of 3 girls who faced systematic brain washing, love jihad(Different styles), forced and trapped conversion which led to one of them landing in Isis territory as sex slave and currently in Afghanistan Jail, but it extends to thousands and thousands of other cases, missing and/or not reported cases. Once in terrorist territory the victims can never return back, since they are terrorists themselves(having travelled on forged passports/visas and supported in crimes against humanity) and have lost their identity in society.

The story, screenplay, direction and acting has been outstanding. All the actors have played their role wonderfully, particularly the lead role of Nimisha played by Adah Sharma.

engineer_anubhav,"I saw the movie with my entire family. It was a very emotional movie. It is not targeting any religion but it shows the fact about kerala. Overall a good experience. Highly Recommended to all.

The film begins with the interrogation of Shalini/Fatima Ba ( Adah Sharma ) by the Afghanistan authority, who has escaped after being captive in an ISIS hideout for a year.

The film then goes into flashbacks, where she narrates her story of how she ended up in the ISIS base in the Afghanistan-Turkey-Syria border.

The story goes back to when Shalini joined a nursing medical college in a district of Kerala and meet Geetanjali (Siddhi Idnani) and Nimah (Yogita Bihani), and another Muslim classmate Asifa (Sonia Balani), who soon starts her plan to brainwash the three girls and recruit them for ISIS.

Sudipto went raw with his content this time and gave some hard-hitting, and strong dialogue. When Shalini is informed that she can't get her phone back as Sharia law doesn't allow women to keep a phone with themselves, she responds with logic and says, 'Jab Sharia law bana tha, tab phone nahi the', and the narrative follows many such scenes, which left the audience smile and clap in the theatre.

The narrative also shows how the fear of Allah is fed to the girls with scripted attacks, fake love angles, and sexual intimacy with an aim to impregnate the women so that they can be taken to Syria at an ISIS base.

Amid the dark elements and a couple of cruel rape scenes, the makers also a glimpse of the culture and beauty of Kerala.

However, the film is based on half-truths and is based on a few statistics. However, when it comes to hard evidence, we all go empty-handed. It's a good debatable topic but the real truth is what we all want to know. Well, the film will make you all Google the real story. So, Good Luck with that!",,11 May 2023,10/10

The film in question is a captivating piece of cinematic artistry that manages to strike a chord with its viewers.

Mostly teeangers should watch it as they are being groomed and brainwashed by I$lamist gangs. This will help them understand how grooming works and they will be aware.

Parents also must watch it as the film clearly shows the importance of parents guidance in life for the kids. How they should know about their dharma and make their children aware of it too.

Direction of the movie was also great. Some violent scenes of execution is shown but nothing too horrid, it is shown only in a moderate way.

shirsaxena,"The movie is filled with A1 shots and frames of most of the scenes were top notch... The comeback of sunidhi chauhan was a big surprise and complemented the intensity of the mood to be expressed... The movie is perfectly able to hit the most controversial topics smoothly and the integration of the dialogues were to good

If you are a GENDER NEUTRAL person the film appropriately suits you and you won't be offended but if not you would be offended a little more than enough

The movie should not be screened to children under 15 because some shots may leave them in curiosity or disturb them mentally....

If looking for a movie for adults like something more than URI THE SURGICAL STRIKE but less than KASHMIR FILES this movie absolutely fits the spot hence being a time deserving movie.",,13 May 2023,9/10
purushotamyt,"The Kerala Store movie is a visually stunning and emotionally gripping film. This movie truly delivers an unforgettable cinematic experience. The Kerala Story movie and The Case are two very different works of art with different forms of storytelling. The Kerala Story movie is a visual medium, while The Case is a written work. Although both pieces focus on the culture and traditions of Kerala, they approach the same topic in different ways. I don't know if this story is real, however it was shown to open the eyes of Sanatani's and tells every Sanatani to not withstand all the plotting against us.

And a also whats internally going on within the nation, the message is very clear in the movie, If you'll be united and educated you'll surely be sustained otherwise ruthlessly you'll be killed.

Same is the case with this movie THE KERALA STORY. Again not much promotion from the team of makers but this masterpiece will gather hearings from its own.

In short . Once in a lifetime movie... Don't miss it... Superb concept & owsm acting by Adah Sharma.. go & watch in theatres only.

This is a movie which is difficult to watch. Not because it is not well made, but because it shows the stark-naked truth in such a simple and devastating manner. Things that happen to the women in this film which is based on real life incidents are not for the weak of stomach. But it's the reality we live in and most would find it convenient to ignore the truth rather than confront it.

As a film, the cinematography is good, the camera work is organic and not overly dramatic. There are some dramatic shots, but those are needed to set the tone of the film. The look and feel of the film seem more real than fictional. This movie feels very authentic in its tonality and stands apart from typical Bollywood films like Kabul Express, Fanaa or Kurbaan.",,8 May 2023,10/10

rohonnag,"Movies can entertain, they can invoke new ideas and sometimes they can bring about change. Change of thought process, change of perspective etc. This is a movie that changes your perception of the world we live in, especially if you don't know what sort of things are happening around us hidden in plain sight.

This is a movie which is difficult to watch. Not because it is not well made, but because it shows the stark-naked truth in such a simple and devastating manner. Things that happen to the women in this film which is based on real life incidents are not for the weak of stomach. But it's the reality we live in and most would find it convenient to ignore the truth rather than confront it.

As a film, the cinematography is good, the camera work is organic and not overly dramatic. There are some dramatic shots, but those are needed to set the tone of the film. The look and feel of the film seem more real than fictional. This movie feels very authentic in its tonality and stands apart from typical Bollywood films like Kabul Express, Fanaa or Kurbaan.

The narrative of the film is nonlinear. It follows roughly three different timelines of the same person. First one of her being in college, another of her in Afghanistan and the last one of her incarcerated at an UN detention camp. The scenes flow mostly seamlessly from one timeline to the other. Sometimes the shift in tonality from a happy and positive interaction in the past to a rather bleak and grim present is done intentionally to jar the audience and shake them from their slumber (figuratively speaking) of believing all is right in the world just because they can't see such things happening in front of them.

All the songs in the film are either used in montage scenes or in the background. There is no waste of time entertainment dance numbers or anything overtly filmi when it comes to the music. The background score is used sparingly but is effective.

Overall: As a film, this is a very tragic subject matter. It's hard to make it through the movie without some sort of emotional reaction, be it sadness, depression or sheer anger. The movie is meant to evoke such reactions. That's what showing the truth as plainly as possible does to the masses. So be warned, this is a film that is hard hitting and not a fun time pass sort of watch. Don't go in with a bunch of friends expecting to have a good time.

Go see it with friends and family to open their eyes on what is going on and what might happen to someone they know and love if we as a society don't hold the people doing such inhuman acts accountable for their actions. This is a film that every Indian needs to see. Its an absolute must watch.

Rating: 7.5/10.

Conclusion: There are no negatives as such in the film, but maybe due to censor board, scenes that are showing the conversion to radical thought process did feel a bit truncated. Some moments of the film could have lingered a tad bit more to hammer the point home. But those are minor gripes in an otherwise well-made film about a very tragic and intense subject matter.",,5 May 2023,8/10

Adah Sharma nailed the show!!! The background music could have been better though. The other supporting characters were bringing the best in Adah Sharma.

If you are looking for a masala movie then it is not your cup of tea. It is based on a very sensitive topic. It will make you uncomfortable.

It shows a very detailed situation of terrorism and it's strategic planning not only in war but in the terms of soft war and brainwashing people. Irrespective of the controversy whether the cases are 32000 or 3, one must understand that even if the case is only ONE still this is what the terrorist have agenda.

ashwinnagar,"The movie Kerala Story is a poignant and thought-provoking portrayal of the dangers and devastation wrought by ISIS terror, particularly in the Indian state of Kerala, which has a large Muslim population. The film sheds light on how ISIS recruits non-Muslim women from Kerala through deceitful means, and then puts them in harm's way on the battlefield, making their lives a living hell. It is a powerful wake-up call for the world to confront the evil designs of this terrorist organization.

Through its gripping narrative and powerful visuals, the movie exposes the insidious tactics used by ISIS to lure young non-Muslim girls, convert them to Islam, and then use them for their own nefarious purposes. The film highlights the stark reality of the situation and makes us aware of the urgent need to act against such heinous acts.

Overall, Kerala Story is a must-watch movie that provides a stark reminder of the dangers posed by terrorism and the need for vigilance against it.

imajinkyajadhav,"Magnificent writing and direction to showcase the reality. Amazing efforts by the entire production. Hard-hitting, reaching audience. The story is similar to the Swedish Web Series Caliphate, and relies on the same background. No wonder this isn't just in India but also in Europe and elsewhere. To that part, the truth has been brought out, and really well presented by the cast. Definitely the best movie I've seen in the recent and among the best movies about modern terrorism and young people's Islamic radicalization from any country, India to be specific. Well-acted, well-paced, nuanced, entirely believable.",,6 May 2023,10/10
kaushaltheguru,"Not for a faint heart, this story makes you squirm. This is story of the infamous ISIS brides and how how deep rooted the network in the ISIS is.

The story is said from a perspective of a victim and we see her story and get connect with her.

We see how she is slowly and steadily gripped in the tentacles of isis.

Some people have not even watched the movie and calling it against a religion, but there is nothing about any religion in the movie this movie is all about how ISIS Operates and their modus oprandi around the world.

And at the end this is a thrilling movie to watch and experience the horrors of terrorism from eyes of the protagonist.",,6 May 2023,10/10

This is a must watch film.

As per story, It is well written and synchronised with the events. Dialogues are impactful and grabs attention significantly.

Direction is fabulous and screenplay is tight, director has left no space where you can feel boredom.

Coming to the performance of actors this feels like the best performance of Adah Sharma. Her expression for the emotional scenes are so raw and natural. Other actresses likes Yogita, Siddhi and Sonia has also done justice to their characters.

So this is a film that everyone must watch at least once.",,5 May 2023,10/10

vtmathewm,"I watched the movie after seeing positive reviews.

Sadly disappointed. As a Keralite it was pushing the limits of my intelligence and sense to watch the pathetic screenplay. Nursing students molested in a Mall in full public view, in Kerala?? No one reacts, not even mobile phone and online media warriors? Come on.

Nursing students seen taking pills given to them just as if it was the most normal thing to do. Even kids would be wary. Whoever wrote the screenplay needs to get a reality check.

A mother whose daughter is missing for long, gets a surprise call from her later from Afghanistan, and she has for her mushy dialogues, like how does it feel to be a mother.

I saw the Hindi version, for some inexplicable reason all actors speak Hindi with a Malayalam accent and Malyalam with a Hindi accent. You can't be both.

At the end, they say they have filed an RTI to verify their own claims of numbers. It's your own claim! You have to provide proof.

Some good cinematography. Other than that, the movie was a torture to watch.",,13 May 2023,2/10
bivuinc,"'The Kerala Story' begins in the interrogation room where Shalini (Adah Sharma) is revealing details of her horrific and tragic past and the reason why she is in a situation of crisis. Her backstory revolves around four college students who have enrolled in a Nursing School in Kasargauda, Kerala. The story is narrated from the perspective of Shalini, who shares a deep bond with her roommates Gitanjali (Siddhi Idnani), Nimah (Yogita Bihani), and Asifa (Sonia Balani). Unbeknownst to others, Asifa has a secret agenda to expose and convert her roommates to Islam. With the assistance of her male associates from outside, she ensures that the girls are radicalized and indoctrinated into the religion using hallucinogenic drugs. After Shalini becomes pregnant, she is compelled to marry someone other than the man who impregnated her, and then embarks on a long journey to Syria via Pakistan and Afghanistan.

At certain points, the film feels more like a tutorial of radicalization than entertainment for the audience. It also goes to extremes to make its point, and that could be quite unsettling for audiences belonging to various communities in our country. After watching 'The Kerala Story,' you may be left with several questions about the current state of the country.

arnabhl,"***The Kerala Story*** Its just a hoax, the whole movie is just feels made up. Nothing looks and feels natual or based on real story.

For me, it's Just a hype created by people.

I don't Care about what others say. The movie is just completely pointless. It feels unnatural.

Its not worth the hype for which people are going Crazy.

The movie claims to be inspired by real-life events, but it seems to be entirely baseless and lacks any real substance. The plot is all over the place, and it's difficult to understand what is happening. The characters are poorly developed, and their motivations are unclear. The dialogues are unconvincing.

Its only the Acting of the Talented Actors which doesn't feel unnatural and feels real.

Despite the movie's claims to be inspired by real-life events, there is no sense of realism or authenticity. The story seems to be fabricated to attract audiences, and the title seems to be a mere marketing ploy. The movie fails to deliver any real emotional impact or make a meaningful statement.

Adah Sharma was able to bring out the emotions and feelings of the audience as it was required from her as an actor. From the South Indian accent to some clap-worthy dialogues, Adah was a treat to watch on the big screen. Sudipto Sen majorly focused on three 'true stories', he did bring out his creative work by not just showing the dark elements but also giving refreshments to his audience by showing the beautiful views of Kerala, a South Indian household, and some college moments. Not only he focused on the plight of the three women but also on the pain that was inflicted on the families. Each woman's story was different from the other but yet connected by the same thread - Terrorism.

Anonymous_ly,"The movie stays to the point for the entire length, the effort to make it in such a way that a typical Indian woman can connect to her daily life, is evident. The parts that appear exaggeratingly violent are unfortunately, factually correct.

The only curse of the movie is that the people have a very rigid perception about the movie, the audience is highly polarized, those who'll watch will support & those who won't will oppose, in all this, the efforts to address an immediate need for a mass level awareness about mainstream beliefs of world's fastest growing religion, are compromised.

One area where it succeeds fully, is in conveying the sorrow of the women portrayed.

Several areas of improvement could be pointed out in terms of subtlety of story & script writing, but they would make the movie irrelevant for the Indian masses.

arifnizamcynic,"Professedly based on ""many true stories"", The Kerala Story, directed by Sudipto Sen, isn't really interested in the truth as a whole. Taking the cases of a handful of missing girls, it spins a yarn that would have us believe that Kerala has contributed thousands of foot soldiers to ISIS over the years. Needless to say, that claim isn't backed up with either evidence or genuine concern.

No more than a lengthy WhatsApp forward in the guise of a movie, The Kerala Story would have been deemed a passable vehicle for a half-baked conspiracy theory had the film not been as laughably inept, both in terms of its making and its tonalities. It cannot by any stretch of the imagination be accused of being a balanced investigation.

A stray shot late in the film is enough to sum up what is wrong with The Kerala Story apart from its lopsided, selective and alarmist theorising about the state's global terror links. On a beach stands a dried-up tree that looks like a prop put there for no particular reason.",,5 May 2023,1/10

Full marks to Adah Sharma for acting and also to the Sonia Balani the girl who plays the role of Asifa. You will get angry seeing her on screen meaning she has done a fantastic job at potraying her character.

You dont feel you are watching the movie but a documentary.

Immense research has gone into the movie of 7 years. Director Sudipto Sen has spoken how he visited Kerala several times in past 7yrs to reseach on the subject and that research shows in the film.

Do not pay attention to the negative press and go watch the movie then do some basic research you will understand what's the reality.

Full marks of chosing the subject and bringing such a movie to light.",,5 May 2023,10/10
mypapa-04559,"This is in real sense called a movie. No hype, no over rated star casts of bollywood but BIG on the story line, a true story of many... These kind of movies takes arduous effort by the movie makers and each of their crew.

Can't stop praising about the skills of the actors in portraying their characters of the real incidents (even happening now) in India.

itprowebsite,"""Keral Story"" is a gripping and thought-provoking film that explores the harsh realities faced by young girls in India who are coerced into converting to Islam and the subsequent struggles they face in adapting to their new way of life. Directed by the talented Naveen John, the film takes an unflinching look at the lives of these girls, and the obstacles they must overcome to find a sense of belonging in a society that has turned its back on them.

The film centers around the story of a young Hindu girl named Meenakshi (played by the talented Anjali Nair), who is forced to convert to Islam by her husband after their marriage. Her journey is one that is filled with heartbreak and struggle, as she tries to navigate the complex and often hostile world of her new religion.

One of the strengths of ""Keral Story"" is the way in which it portrays the complex and nuanced nature of religious conversion. The film does not take a simplistic approach to this subject, but rather explores the different motivations and factors that can lead someone to convert. In the case of Meenakshi, her conversion is motivated by love for her husband, but also by a desire to escape the poverty and hardship of her old life.

The film also does an excellent job of showing the ways in which conversion can be used as a tool of control and manipulation by those in power. Meenakshi's husband is portrayed as a domineering figure who uses religion as a means of exerting control over her, and it is clear that his motivations are not purely spiritual. This aspect of the film is particularly relevant in the context of contemporary India, where there has been a rise in incidents of forced conversion.

The performances in ""Keral Story"" are uniformly excellent, with Anjali Nair delivering a powerful and nuanced portrayal of Meenakshi. Her journey from a naive and vulnerable young girl to a strong and independent woman is both moving and inspiring, and Nair is able to convey a wide range of emotions with subtlety and skill.

The supporting cast is also impressive, with notable performances from Sudhi Koppa as Meenakshi's husband, and Surabhi Lakshmi as her friend and confidante. The chemistry between the actors feels natural and authentic, and the relationships between the characters are one of the film's strongest aspects.

One of the most striking elements of ""Keral Story"" is its visual style. The film is shot in a naturalistic and understated manner, with a focus on capturing the everyday details of life in rural India. The use of light and shadow is particularly effective, and the cinematography is able to convey a sense of the harsh beauty of the Indian landscape.

The film's soundtrack is also noteworthy, with a haunting and evocative score that complements the visuals perfectly. The use of traditional Indian instruments, such as the sitar and tabla, gives the film an authentic and immersive feel, and the music is able to convey the complex emotions of the characters with great subtlety and nuance.

Overall, ""Keral Story"" is a powerful and emotionally resonant film that deals with important issues in a sensitive and nuanced manner. The film's exploration of the complexities of religious conversion, and the ways in which it can be used as a tool of control, is particularly relevant in the context of contemporary India. The performances are uniformly excellent, and the visual and musical elements of the film are both impressive and effective. Director Naveen John has crafted a film that is both thought-provoking and moving, and ""Keral Story"" is a must-see for anyone interested in exploring the complexities of religion, gender, and power.",,5 May 2023,10/10

This movie was an eye opener, later when I researched on internet I was shocked that it's actually very true.

milkiway-26141,"The Kerala Story is a powerful and thought-provoking film that tackles the controversial and sensitive issue of Love Jihad. The film revolves around the story of Shalini Unnikrishnan, Nimah, and Geetanjali, who become victims of a Love Jihad ploy orchestrated by an ISIS aide.

The performances by the entire cast, especially Adah Sharma's award-winning portrayal of Shalini, were remarkable. The film's technical aspects, including the locations, cinematography, editing, and music, were all top-notch.

The film's depiction of violence and rape can be disturbing for some viewers. However, it was necessary to showcase the plight of the 32,000 Non-Muslim Indian girls from Kerala who were brainwashed, converted, impregnated, and sent to terror camps, raped, and ended up as sex slaves in ISIS camps in Syria and Afghanistan.

The film didn't portray Islam in a negative light and even showed its respect for the religion in some instances. The dialogues related to religion were thought-provoking and elicited both laughs and moments of reflection.

Overall, The Kerala Story is a must-watch for those who appreciated The Kashmir Files. The film is made in a bold and uncompromising manner and offers a realistic and poignant experience. However, it's recommended only for strong hearts due to its intense subject matter.

Director Sudipto Sen and the entire cast and crew deserve praise for their efforts in bringing such an important issue to the forefront through cinema. The Kerala Story is not just a film but a call to action for society to address and combat Love Jihad.",,6 May 2023,10/10

pirtaesking,"""The Converted"" appears to be a movie that tackles important and relevant themes related to religious extremism and terrorism. The story of Fatima Ba is likely to be an emotional and thought-provoking journey that sheds light on the power of manipulation and the dangers of religious fanaticism. The film has the potential to spark important discussions about the impact of terrorism on individuals and society, as well as the need to combat extremism in all its forms. However, it is difficult to assess the movie's execution or quality without having seen it. Overall, ""The Converted"" sounds like an important and timely film that has the potential to make a significant impact.

The movie features powerful performances from its ensemble cast, and the direction is skillful in building tension and suspense throughout the narrative.

krishtealovestealove-81469,"The Kerala Story is a movie that delves into the issue of alleged radicalization and forced conversion of young Hindu women to Islam in Kerala, after which they are coerced into joining ISIS. The movie is based on a true story of three young girls from different parts of Kerala, and the role of Shalini/Fatima is played by Adah Sharma, who delivers a powerful and emotionally stirring performance.

The director Sudipto Sen has chosen a sensitive and complex subject, and the treatment of the film is said to be difficult to watch with several disturbing scenes, moments and dialogues. However, some reviews suggest that the treatment gets increasingly guided more by local politics than cinematic sagacity. While the movie does have some poignant moments, for the most part, it is either the gullible girls eager to buy the propaganda or sly creatures with Muslim names; there is no voice of sanity, and nuance is nowhere to be found.

The movie also features the narration of a converted Muslim woman, Fatima Ba, who shares her story of being abducted from her home and manipulated by religious vanguards to become an ISIS terrorist, eventually landing her in an Afghanistan jail.

The Kerala Story is a movie that highlights a critical issue that is currently affecting many parts of the world, and it is commendable that the director has chosen to bring attention to this subject. The movie attempts to showcase the harrowing experiences of the young girls who are forced to convert and join ISIS, and the emotional toll that this takes on them and their families. Adah Sharma's performance as Shalini/Fatima is powerful, and she brings depth and nuance to her character.

However, as some reviews suggest, the movie could have delved deeper into the issue and provided more nuanced and balanced portrayals of the characters involved. While it is important to raise awareness about the issue of forced conversions and radicalization, it is also important to avoid stereotyping and demonizing entire communities, which can fuel existing biases and prejudices.

Overall, The Kerala Story is a movie that attempts to shine a light on a critical issue, and the performances of the actors, especially Adah Sharma, are noteworthy. However, the treatment of the film could have been more nuanced and balanced to provide a deeper understanding of the complex issues involved. It is a movie worth watching, but with the understanding that it portrays a highly sensitive subject that needs to be examined with care and caution.",,5 May 2023,10/10

nitsvirusboyz,"The Kerala Story is a hard-hitting, shocking, and disturbing film that leaves the viewers with a feeling of discomfort. The story of the film revolves around love-jihad, brutal inhuman crimes such as rape, sex slavery, radicalisation, indoctrination, and ISIS recruitment. Even if the shreds of evidence are lacking, the makers would like you to believe that these events are inspired by true incidents. If you still don't believe that then the victim and the parents of the victims speak at the end of the movie making it more believable.

The director and writers of the film managed to keep the story intriguing. The dialogues are powerful but few are manipulative and it tries to provoke hate. The first half is engaging, fast-paced, and quickly introduces us to three nursing students in Kerala who are brainwashed by an extremist group and makes them believe that only Islam can be their saviour. The screenplay in the second half is engrossing and keeps you hooked until the end of the film. The parallel storylines showing the past and present scenes are well-edited and well-balanced.

Adah Sharma delivers a praiseworthy performance and she has done complete justice to the character of vulnerable Shalini. Her Malayali accent is spot on. Yogita Bihani and Siddhi Idnani played their part very well. Sonia Balani's dialogue delivery and her performance as Asifa was excellent. Other supporting actors played their parts with utmost sincerity.

swaroopnagraj,"The film is an eye-opener. Every Indian should watch this no matter their religion or state. Because this movie shows the truth about Monotheistic Abrahamic religions which only believe in one God and completely reject people belonging to other faiths.

The movie shows the raw stories that happen in countries of the Middle-east, where ISIS and other terror organizations operate. The movie doesn't shy away from depicting blood and gore that is common to desert cultures and people.

People are saying that the makers of the movie lied and that they don't have any proof over the claims of 32,000 women from Kerala being took to Syria. But I would like to ask all of those people, that even if 1 girl has gone through such a blood-curdling experience, isn't this fact itself more than enough to make a movie about the girl's life and why she choose this path.

The purpose of the film is mainly to create awareness and prevent such things from happening in the future and the movie has done an amazing job in this regard. As the message is loud and clear, that anyone who has grand foolish dreams about the ""After-life"" and decides to take the path mentioned in the film, will end up in the same situation as the girl depicted in the movie.

Overall, Sudipto Sen has done an amazing job. The film feels like its almost taken out from a Documentary shot in Syria or Afghanistan. The actors were brilliant especially Adah Sharma, who has done a terrific job and if I may say so, put her ""HEAD"" on the line to make this movie a success. So she deserves all the applause.

Finally, I would like to say that movies are made and released almost every week. But to make a movie like this which shows hardcore facts and throws these facts on the face of those people who are in denial of such obnoxious truths that is happening not only in Kerala, but also in developed countries like US and UK, is praise-worthy and requires some serious balls which Sudipto has proven he has.",,5 May 2023,10/10
qymhxmk,"Apart from all the controversies, everything is perfect, the direction, the screenplays, the dialogues, the sounds, music, story building, locations and at last the facts

I am so proud that the producers, directors and actors got some courage and brought this fact to people.

From our childhood we have been told to keep quiet on everything even if it's a wrong thing, they run fake propaganda agenda like PK and try to ban real events.

And the real sad thing is even if we know the truth today we can't do much because immediately the events are tagged with religions, and political naxals come forward to save the guilties.

This will definitely save lives of many girls.",,5 May 2023,10/10
moviebluffhere,"Kerala Story must be lauded not because it's an exceptional piece of cinema - or that it subverts some conventions in filmmaking. In fact, on the technical front, it is mediocre at best BUT it is brave attempt to showcase, and perhaps start a conversation about the cultural programming against a community and their religion. It succeeds in capturing the potential of radicalism in Islam, it's dangerous insistence on being non-accepting of other religions, and most importantly it's violent canvassing for the name of ""Allah"" at the cost of subjecting others to absolute cruelty.

It also presents, though a messy, picture of the politics at play. But as was previously mentioned, the movie needs to be lauded because it is unapologetic and thankfully not politically correct. The angst, the contained pain is visible.

Adah Sharma is very convincing in her role, and so are the other two new comers. The music is a little off putting but overall, being an important film it must be watched at least once. Perhaps, it's one of the earlier movies that are going to deal with this subject in a more mature manner. But I'm not going to deduct stars for that. I couldn't have expected a masterpiece especially when there's so much of establishment hellbent on stalling the movie's release.",,5 May 2023,Pas de note

sanyogjain-44004,It was a difficult task to bring such Reality in reels. For soft hearted Sanatani it is not easy to digest but sooner or later every Kafir will associate this in real life. If you learn from this movie and accept the Reality to never fall in similar situation. Nice location and cinematography. Regional language could have been avoided in Hindi version as it makes it difficult to understand at times. Story narration in the background could have been better for audience who don't want to use minds while entertaining themselves. Full paisa wasool. Kudos to Team Kerela Story.

Kulin33,"The script is very well written and directing is superb & with a strong message in the end just sparks some thing inside you.

It's a movie based on true story that needs to be heard, it will give you chills in the middle as the story goes forward.

Acting was ok, nothing spectacular plus the budget was also low due to which the sets and customers looked weak. But overall an good attempt to make a decent movie with just limited production budget.

A lot of controversies have happened around the movie but it's because of the number that the film makers have shown, that is 32,000 girls went missing.

lakshmishaks88,"""The Kerala Story"" is a compelling and thought-provoking film that sheds light on a subject that has remained untold for far too long. Inspired by true incidents, the movie follows the journey of Shalini Unnikrishnan, played brilliantly by Adah Sharma, as she navigates a dangerous world.

Director Sen employs a shock-and-awe approach, similar to ""The Kashmir Files,"" which adds to the film's compelling nature. The visuals are powerful from the start, with Shalini portrayed as a trapped and manipulated victim. Adah Sharma delivers a bold performance, capturing the essence of her character and bringing attention to the challenges faced by individuals in similar situations.

The plot revolves around Shalini, a student who moves to Kasargod to pursue her studies. There, she encounters three roommates from different backgrounds, setting the stage for intense discussions and exploration of diverse ideologies. These thought-provoking debates raise questions about faith and add depth to the narrative.

As the story unfolds, Shalini faces orchestrated social situations designed to exploit her vulnerability. The film delves into the tactics used by manipulative individuals, shedding light on the methods employed to exert control and influence. Sen provides valuable insight into the complexities of manipulation and radicalization.

Adah Sharma and the supporting cast deliver commendable performances, portraying their characters with authenticity and emotional depth. Their portrayal adds credibility to the narrative, capturing the struggles faced by victims and evoking empathy from the audience.

""The Kerala Story"" also addresses the need for broader conversations about individual freedoms and the protection of human rights. It prompts viewers to reflect on societal norms and the importance of understanding diverse perspectives.

The post-credits scene is particularly moving, as the film includes testimonials from real-life victims' families. This raw and emotional footage serves as a reminder of the real-world impact of extremism and the pain endured by those affected. It leaves a lasting impact on the audience.

While the storyboarding could benefit from further refinement, the filmmakers and crew deserve recognition for their courage in tackling a sensitive subject. By bringing awareness to the struggles faced by victims, they shed light on an important issue that demands attention.

""The Kerala Story"" is a film that should be seen by many, as it brings awareness to the challenges and experiences of victims. It encourages viewers to consider the power of manipulation and serves as a reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding.",,10 May 2023,9/10
sameerlodaya,"Sameer lodaya

The movie emphasised too much on the cross borders of Islamic countries rather than the main content of brain washing and converting to other religion

The content is very tough and is hard to accept the pain of these girls who were influenced to change their minds ,thoughts and religions by a group of separatists

Adah gave a fabulous performance from innocent to militant with good support from other fellow actors

Some scenes were too harsh and were not easy to digest only if you are mentally strong then only go for this movie..the pain has been elongated too much

Some negatives like the pace of the movie is slow in first half..too much of I'll treat was shown on women of other countries which was not required..showing the travel to countries in illegal ways was out of context

I still find the trailer was nerve breaking rather then the movie.",,5 May 2023,6/10

nadkarnisumeet,"The Kerala Story review :

Not as hard hitting and engaging as The Kashmir Files (2022), The Kerala Story is still a pertinent take on the religious conversions which we keep hearing in the news. The fact that these Hindu women were not just converted but also instigated to join the ISIS as sex slaves makes for a chilling and compelling watch.

The subtle manner in which the brain washing starts... and where it finally ends is accurately depicted in the movie. The desert locales have an authentic look and the performances from the entire cast, particularly Adah Sharma is first rate. Vipul Amrutlal Shah has touched a daringly realistic subject this time and done fair justice to it though the film has its share of flaws.

The background score jars at times. The Malayalam dialogues with sudden Hindi words in between don't work. And frankly, the easy peasy way in which the two nursing students get convinced by their conniving roommate to change their religion appears a tad too convenient from a writing perspective. The entire brain washing process needed more gravitas..

Having said that, The Kerala Story is a relevant piece of cinema. Such 'love jihad' incidents have indeed taken place and will continue until we have strict enforceable laws in place. This film will at least pose as a warning or a deterrant to the impressionable youngsters falling in to this vicious trap. Recommended stuff!!

anjanashrestha2,"The moment I heard about this movie, I wanted to watch it. I did not have much expectations wrt the direction and the execution of the movie considering the challenging nature of the subject matter. So, I went to watch it ready to accept its subpar performance.

The movie was as expected. The cinematography of the deserts of Afghanistan was very beautiful. The depiction of the people and the culture shown was convincing to me (I haven't done any fact-checking but going with what the movie shows). Credit goes to the individual who conceptualized and captured those locations.

By watching the movie, yes, you understand how the so-called naïve girls are radicalized. However, the radicalization part has been a bit overdone and emphasized a bit more. It lacked the subtleties and the nuances but as I mentioned before, I was expecting that by the look of the trailers. That over-emphasis part can be paralleled with the movie ""3 idiots"" where the characters overplay to explain a point. It looks like the movie makers want to make sure that everyone understood the message loud and clear.

Having said that, the performance from the characters seemed a bit scripted, who otherewise looked talented. I should however commend on Adah Sharma's performance. Given the movies I watched of her (Haseen to Phaseen and Commando 2 or 3), I think this movie gave her a big break. It may even nominate her for the best performance (female) in the movie awards next year. (In fact, the movie itself may earn a couple of nominations.) She may have missed some nuances here and there but that is forgivable, at least to me, given that she still executed the tough role with such determination and courage. Kudos to her!

I am happy that the movie did well. If movies like Pathaan can break the box office, I really think The Kerala Story definitely deserves a chance. It has touched upon such an important issue. Once again, I don't know the facts but given that this is based on a true story, it reflects the ugly truths of the society. It at least makes people think, create an awareness and have them digging for facts. I would any day go and watch and support movies like these than going for Pathaan or like movies. I am not trying to say they are not good or entertaining but I am not drawn to movies that attract people solely by the virtue of big stars, bodies and glamour.

TKS is a movie that is very different and probably the first one in Hindi language (not sure about others) that has been made in the topic. Kudos to the movie makers for making that and for making us think.",,13 May 2023,7/10

sujan854,"The story is good and i think its brave for the director and writer to make a movie about this. But why didn't they try to get better actors for the movie? You can see bad acting from the beginning. The main character Shalini did fine, but those three people taking her interrogation didn't show any expression. They were like reading their lines. This happens for most of the characters. Director should have guided them better. Except for shalini's mother, shalini and her christian friend, none of the actors were even okayish. They were so bad.

Background score made me cringe so many times. Almost every time a muslim girl or any other muslim talks, there is a villain music, even when they are having normal convo. This movie goes too much against muslim.

In the hands of the better moviemaker, this movie could have been great. I don't mind it being controversial because the story is about something that happened in real life. So, there is no problem in subject matter. But the director should go to a film school and hire a better casting director. I still admire him for what he has tried but come on, this is not the way to tell such a serious story.

One more thing, what's up with the subtitles? Can hardly even read them. Even before the dialogue ends, the subtitles of that dialogue goes away. Also, let the scene play out for a while, you don't need to cut it out so quickly.",,20 May 2023,1/10

boystarx-619-276074,"Watched #TheKeralaStory

Simply, a well made movie and good to watch watch in theaters. I had thought, it probably would be a bit cringe worthy to portray it's point but it was'nt.

The movie keeps the audience glued all along and doesn't drag anything. Gets to the point carefully and truthfully. Some scenes can make your eyes wet without over doing on anything. Does remind me of The Kashmir Files and it's careful approach to not get into religious debates and controversies. But the movie making approach is different from TKF. It does opens up the dark truths that have been brushed under the carpet in India but one can relate immediately based on such news that we have read earlier.

Direction is very good, it doesn't let you down and keeps you engaged without one coming out of the zone. It could have been better to Hollywood standards but that's something every Indian movie can be accused of.

Screenplay too is good, its simpler than TKF and mostly linear, keeping Indian audiences in mind. But it does it's job and doesn't drags or make you feel spoon fed at all.

Acting is awesome, every actor has done well in the limited space that they were given. But Adah Sharma steels the show, she amazes you with her acting. She proves, she is totally not a rookie for her debut performance(I guess). Kangana Ranaut would be proud of her acting for sure, that's how good she was.

Makeup and Costume, usually we dont talk about this aspect but makeup and costume work is so good that it simply stands out and gets noticed. Only in few movies you can see this aspect. The initial scene, notice the skin on her face or the condition of her hand, it feels so real. Notice the intricacies in dresses based on location and one scene where she gets ready to flee.

Surprisingly, a couple of background songs are too good, it comes without interrupting the movie and well placed. The lyrics and arrangement are both worth appreciating. The background score is also well in tune with the movie.

This movie also subtly touches issues happening in other parts of the world, indicatively, guess openly would have been better. Some scenes are not good to watch with conservative elders or children but the pain is universal and relatable for everyone.

At the end, there are real testimonies, proving to you that you didn't waste your money and emotion into some false narrative and the issue is real and horrific. Most people were teary eyed at the end, including me. Kudos to the courage of producers to pick this issue, make a film and put the pain of unspoken people in limelight. Hope this movie brings a positive change and no other girl or man gets trapped on something that is draconian to say the least. Do go and watch the movie.",,6 May 2023,10/10

Hopefully more movies are made in future so that people come to know the reality. Adah Sharma has acted very well and the movie seems quite disturbing.

kanishka-428-568356,"Given so many reviews are already out - here's a different take! :)

If there is one aspect where this movies seems unprecedented - it is the boldness of the topic and the blunt, yet balanced handling. Its hard to believe such a movie was conceived, produced and tasted such success in a country which used to on the forefront to ban books and any material deemed sensitive to a community!

So does the movie target a community? Not really. The makers have taken a real problem e.g. Radicalisation to convey their point. But what's the real point?

Perhaps, the real point is about one's inherent inability to deal with such meticulously planned devious attacks. If there is one point common in all the protagonists, none of them seem to had any trusted support group. The generation gap causing limited communication with the parents. So the protagonists are like a groups of deers under attack by a pride of lions. A group of confused and ill-prepared teen-adults. And one of the attackers is with them round the clock. Think a bit about it. Its a deadly combination. The targets don't stand much of a chance. And that's where the controversy lies. A full proof plan where the girl leaves for another country and then goes incommunicado. The only way to find the correct no may be to open a hotline and request people to share information. So the actual no is probably never going to come out.

The movie is based on true incidents and depicts the struggles of a young girl who is forced to work as a domestic worker to support her family. The movie showcases the stark differences between the rich and poor in Kerala and the exploitation that takes place in the name of domestic work.

The acting in the movie is outstanding and the cast has done a commendable job in portraying the complex emotions of the characters. The lead actress delivers a standout performance as the young girl who is forced to grow up too quickly and shoulder the burden of her family's financial woes. Her portrayal of the character's struggles and determination is truly inspiring and heart-wrenching.

The hard-hitting facts presented in the movie are eye-opening and shed light on the dark underbelly of Kerala society. The movie shows how the system has failed to protect the rights of the poor and how they are often exploited by the wealthy. The movie also highlights the role of the media and how it can be used to expose injustice and bring about change.

The cinematography and direction of the movie are also worth mentioning. The director has done a brilliant job in bringing the story to life and capturing the beauty of Kerala on camera. The movie's score is also noteworthy, adding to the emotional impact of the story.

Overall, ""Kerala Story"" is a must-watch for anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of the social issues that plague Kerala society. The movie is a powerful reminder that there is still a long way to go in terms of achieving social justice and equality for all. The movie is a testament to the power of cinema in raising awareness and inspiring change.",,9 May 2023,10/10
ronaldosd-73636,"This was painful to watch and extremely painful that thought of those girls who had gone through. The movie is a brilliant enactment of the situation that has befallen the Indian state better known as gods own country. It's a film based on facts and available evidences, and definitely requires a great courage to make. The storytelling and the drama is spot on, the production by Vipul Amrutlal Shah was excellent, cinematography is top notch, music and other technical departments are also well done. Shocked, and speechless after watching.

Overall a must watch film. You may find yourself both whimpering and extremely angry as you watch the second half of the Kerala story.",,7 May 2023,9/10
naimishawasthi,"Was terrified after watching the horrendous and extremely explicit scenes. Movie is not for weak hearted people as it will incite havoc in your mind. One of the career best performances by Adah Sharma playing a sweet innocent yet relentless mentally strong girl.

Brilliant direction by Sudipto Sen for presenting this issue so candidly. A bold and courageous move by filmmakers to bring out such a sensitive and controversial topic. Movie does an excellent job of raising awareness about the dangers of radicalization and how it impacts communities.

You cannot take your eyes off screen even for a second though you'll want to close your senses in some of the scenes.",,9 May 2023,10/10
aanand_ub,"Pace and immersiveness

In the initial 20 minutes or so the performances and story line looked very typical, predictable and plastic. However I did not notice when I lost myself into the plot and storyline. The pace of the movie was quick which could be the reason why the movie could hold interest throughout its running time.

Acting and screen time

The lead role have been been played exceptionally well. The cast selected for different roles were well looking and with easily recognizable facial features and personalities. It was really a tricky task to make multiple ideologies of numerous characters easily identifiable. The plight and condition of parents could have been more. I felt that the amount of screen time and dialogues delivered by parents should have been more, even if that had added 5 more minutes to an already long movie. In reality the parents suffer as much as the children and their voices should have been portrayed more. Overall, every character has played the role well.

Sets and Picturization

The cinematography is just beautiful and breathtaking. At times I wondered if I should celebrate the scenery or lament upon the sensitivity of the situation. It makes me wonder how much detailing was done to make the sets, makeup and costume appear and match so realistically with intended spots. I felt that in few of the introductory scenes rendition of traditional Kerala culture and costumes was stereotypical. But I am not sure if such culture and costume are prominently visible in real life there as I have never visited Kerala. The editing could have been done better if there has not been any kind of censorship or public reaction. It really appears on few occasions that some editing was done under external pressure.

Dialogues and Music

The dialogues were perfectly written and delivered. The music gave goosebumps. The arguments given by one of the leading characters were uncannily similar to the arguments presented by guests and callers in Ex-Muslim streams on youtube. I wonder how the production team found out about the precise rhetoric used in real life for brain washing. The lead role must have practiced hard to get the perfect Hindi accent of Kerala people.

Facts and fiction

The factual and fictional content of the movie can be said to be 50-50. The final mental state of the lead character in the movie and the metal state of real life victims in their video interviews is just the opposite! The sequence of incidents, the way passports are switched from real to fake to avoid tracks of traveling to middle east and the ultimate destiny of victims has been shown correctly. The suffering and torture suffered by sex slaves has been quite diluted. The amount of violence show is heavily diluted as compared to real life footages, but it is still slightly more than what a common person can tolerate.

Coverage of the Issue

The movies covers almost all doctrines of taqiyya, kitman, tawriay, taysir, darura and marura by depicting the techniques of affair, assault, drugs, desertation, extortion, emotional exploitation and above all fear and greed. The methods used by scammers are precise and require training. The points on which I disagree with the movie is that the film shows 100% success rate of these traditional deceptive methods but we know in real life failure do happen and miss rates must be quite high. Some may find the story awkward or not so typical of an interesting movie, but real life is like that. People can be scammed in so many ways that the more you show the worse the story will become. Still, the movie succeeds in covering most of the typical methods with minimum damage to the main story.

Conclusion

Acting, dialoges, narration, picturization, music are good. The way some Hindu religious figures have been ridiculed might offend some Hindus, though nothing serious or offensive has been told or shown about any religion given that it is impossible to separate religion from the underlying phenomena in this kind of scam.",,7 May 2023,10/10

vivchopra,"""The Kerala Story"" is a powerful and thought-provoking film that delves deep into the captivating narrative of three young girls who become the targets of an ISIS sleeper cell in Kerala, India. The movie takes us on a harrowing journey as these girls are subjected to relentless attempts at brainwashing, aimed at converting them to Islam. What unfolds is a chilling depiction of the lengths to which these extremists will go to achieve their objectives, employing subtle techniques of manipulation and coercion.

The film shines a light on the unimaginable brutality faced by the girls once they are ensnared in the web of this extremist ideology. It unflinchingly portrays the physical abuses, atrocities, and even the sexual enslavement that awaits those who succumb to the pressure to convert. The impact of these experiences reverberates not only through the lives of the girls themselves but also through their families, who must grapple with the devastating aftermath of their loved ones' entanglement with ISIS.

What sets ""The Kerala Story"" apart is its foundation in real events. Through meticulous research, it becomes evident that this alarming phenomenon extends far beyond the borders of Kerala, resonating in various parts of India and the world. This realization adds a chilling sense of urgency to the film, urging viewers, particularly girls and parents, to remain informed, exercise caution, and prioritize their safety in the face of such dangers.

It is crucial to acknowledge that ""The Kerala Story"" offers a specific perspective on ISIS and its interpretation of Islam and Sharia law. It is not intended as a sweeping critique of Islam or Muslims in general. Rather, the film aims to shed light on the ideology propagated by ISIS and the perilous consequences it poses. By focusing on the actions and beliefs of this extremist group, the movie aims to ignite discussion and raise awareness about the dangers that lurk within society.

""The Kerala Story"" is a must-watch film that merits attention on a global scale. Its ability to captivate audiences while shedding light on a pressing issue is commendable. By weaving together a gripping narrative based on real events, the film educates viewers about the dangers of extremist ideologies and the importance of remaining vigilant. It serves as a clarion call to society to come together, engage in dialogue, and take proactive steps to safeguard the well-being and safety of individuals, especially vulnerable young girls.

In summary, ""The Kerala Story"" is a cinematic masterpiece that confronts audiences with the harsh realities faced by those ensnared in the clutches of extremist ideologies. It offers a poignant portrayal of resilience and serves as a catalyst for conversation and action. By watching this film, audiences are compelled to confront the pervasive threat of radicalization and unite in the pursuit of a safer and more secure future for all.",,17 May 2023,10/10
jay-techie2007,"Quite an intense movie. Well made, though it could have been better, especially when comparing it with The Kashmir Files, Kantara or Malikappuram.

But this is a must watch to understand how we, as parents, set up our kids for failure against proselytization when they don't know well enough about our belief system, culture and traditions. In extreme cases, like the one depicted in this movie, they are gobbled up into the world of global terrorism through gradual indoctrination. It shows our blindspots and how, not having kids rooted in our culture, can lead to them getting planted elsewhere.

Good casting with some solid performances. Adah Sharma takes the movie on her shoulders and does a good job of it. The story is well paced - broken into three parts - present, immediate past, and further past - keeping the audience hooked.

priyaranjansamal-39765,"I was Shocked, and speechless after watching ""The Kerala Story"". While watching felt like I was not ready to watch such brutal truth.

Those who are saying this is propaganda by RSS, Kindly go and watch ""Caliphate- On NETFLIX (2020)"" a Swedish Webseries, based on the same concept, but in Sweden, there is no RSS or BJP, then why they made this?

If you ignore the fact of ""Love Zihad"", it will not change the reality, but yes one day it will affect your family and you will be alone that day.

'The Kerala Story' begins in the interrogation room where Shalini (Adah Sharma) is revealing details of her horrific and tragic past and the reason why she is in a situation of crisis. Her backstory revolves around four college students who have enrolled in a Nursing School in Kerala. It's a raw, gripping screenplay with excellent performances by all actors. The narrative is crisp and the director Sudipto Sen sir has done a fantastic job! Few scenes are too tough and very disturbing to watch!!

On a personal level and on a societal level it is very important for us to go back to our roots, know about our history and understand our Sanatan dharma.

bc_raghavendra-604-485763,"Since my native place is near to Mangalore, I know the incidents of the movie are true.

Whereas I am giving only 6 star to this movie because the script should have had more clarity on characters. For example, when the leading character Shalini was taken to SriLanka, she gets a call from her hostel friend who says that they all are trapped. But why didn't Shalini try to escape from SriLanka itself, since she realized about trap? Why did she kept on believing her husband till she reaches Afghanistan?

When Shalini gets cheated by her boy friend, then why did she listen to Maulvi instead of reaching to her mother?

There is no reasons shown in the movie for these.",,23 May 2023,6/10

arvindsamsani,"Keeping politics aside, The Kerala Story has enough potential to become the voice of helpless ISIS brides, but the director messed it up. With such an intense subject, he could have made the movie look more raw and natural. Instead, the director chose to downplay it and made it look like a documentary. The movie has some really good technical values. Camera work was convincing and editing was crisp. There are couple of songs which added some depth to the narrative. But the background score was a let down.

Coming to performances, Adah Sharma nailed it as Shalini. Others were okay and they have given whats needed. Overall, its a pretty decent film but has its flaws.",,6 May 2023,7/10
moviebluffhere,"Kerala Story (2023) must be lauded not because it is an exceptional piece of cinema - or that it subverts some conventions in filmmaking. In fact, on the technical front, it is mediocre at best but it is bold attempt to showcase, and perhaps start a conversation about the cultural programming against a community and their religion. It succeeds in capturing the potential of radicalism in Islam, its dangerous insistence on being non-accepting of other religions, and most importantly its violent canvassing for the name of ""Allah"" at the cost of subjecting others to absolute cruelty.

It also presents, though a messy, picture of the politics at play. But as was previously mentioned, the movie needs to be lauded because it is unapologetic and thankfully not politically correct. The angst, the contained pain is visible.

Adah Sharma is very convincing in her role, and so are the other two new comers. Being an important film it must be watched at least once. Perhaps, it is one of the earlier movies that are going to deal with this subject in a more mature manner. But I am not going to deduct stars for that. I couldn't have expected a masterpiece especially when there is so much of establishment hellbent on stalling the movie's release. It all makes sense why. The movie stirs some questions for sure - and also forces one to think why a movie like this needs to be stopped from releasing when everyone one way or the other is seeing this happen everyday. Perhaps, the filmmaker's lack of political correctness disturbs some.

Also, the movie features some really disturbing sequences of sexual assault and violence. Though the visceral impact is not as intense as The Kashmir Files (2022), it might be traumatising for some viewers.",,7 May 2023,Pas de note

Adaha Sharma's did a bold movie selection once more. Her role of a naive girl was well justified by her acting

The other negative and postive characters too played their part good.

mandarsawant-14413,"The film depicts true story of 3 girls who faced systematic brain washing, love jihad(Different styles), forced and trapped conversion which led to one of them landing in Isis territory as sex slave and currently in Afghanistan Jail, but it extends to thousands and thousands of other cases, missing and/or not reported cases. Once in terrorist territory the victims can never return back, since they are terrorists themselves(having travelled on forged passports/visas and supported in crimes against humanity) and have lost their identity in society.

The story, screenplay, direction and acting has been outstanding. All the actors have played their role wonderfully, particularly the lead role of Nimisha played by Adah Sharma.

engineer_anubhav,"I saw the movie with my entire family. It was a very emotional movie. It is not targeting any religion but it shows the fact about kerala. Overall a good experience. Highly Recommended to all.

The film begins with the interrogation of Shalini/Fatima Ba ( Adah Sharma ) by the Afghanistan authority, who has escaped after being captive in an ISIS hideout for a year.

The film then goes into flashbacks, where she narrates her story of how she ended up in the ISIS base in the Afghanistan-Turkey-Syria border.

The story goes back to when Shalini joined a nursing medical college in a district of Kerala and meet Geetanjali (Siddhi Idnani) and Nimah (Yogita Bihani), and another Muslim classmate Asifa (Sonia Balani), who soon starts her plan to brainwash the three girls and recruit them for ISIS.

Sudipto went raw with his content this time and gave some hard-hitting, and strong dialogue. When Shalini is informed that she can't get her phone back as Sharia law doesn't allow women to keep a phone with themselves, she responds with logic and says, 'Jab Sharia law bana tha, tab phone nahi the', and the narrative follows many such scenes, which left the audience smile and clap in the theatre.

The narrative also shows how the fear of Allah is fed to the girls with scripted attacks, fake love angles, and sexual intimacy with an aim to impregnate the women so that they can be taken to Syria at an ISIS base.

Amid the dark elements and a couple of cruel rape scenes, the makers also a glimpse of the culture and beauty of Kerala.

However, the film is based on half-truths and is based on a few statistics. However, when it comes to hard evidence, we all go empty-handed. It's a good debatable topic but the real truth is what we all want to know. Well, the film will make you all Google the real story. So, Good Luck with that!",,11 May 2023,10/10

The Kerala Story movie and The Case are two very different works of art with different forms of storytelling. The Kerala Story movie is a visual medium, while The Case is a written work. Although both pieces focus on the culture and traditions of Kerala, they approach the same topic in different ways. I don't know if this story is real, however it was shown to open the eyes of Sanatani's and tells every Sanatani to not withstand all the plotting against us. Since, the old times, we've been plotted against and we're kept away from the truth.",,8 May 2023,10/10

A must watch picture which tells the root cause between a ideology which is just to follow a path way by the medium of fear.

And a also whats internally going on within the nation, the message is very clear in the movie, If you'll be united and educated you'll surely be sustained otherwise ruthlessly you'll be killed.

The direction and the proof given about the incident on the end of the movie justifying the reality of the rigid mindset.

Same is the case with this movie THE KERALA STORY. Again not much promotion from the team of makers but this masterpiece will gather hearings from its own.

These type of movies have 2 big factors to dictate their fortunes - One is the concept on which they are based and other is the Cast and their acting skills.

I want to ask the makers of this film , Could not the protagonist have abandoned her daughter whose father was an ISIS sleeper cell who ditched her? Seriously that scene was cringeworthy.

The Kerala Story (2023) shows every aspect which was intentionally/unintentionally missed out by the hit TV Series from Sweden, Caliphate (2020), also clearly mentioning the Bhartiya (Indian) context and how certain ideologies threaten the peace and prosperity of unity in diversity of which Bharat is a prime example prior to the advent of Abrahamic religions' invasive and destructive coloniality.",,16 May 2023,10/10

Although I was aware of the events in Kerala, this film did a remarkable job of telling the story of Nimisha and her friends. This film does not criticise any one religion; instead, it merely depicts the actions of a small number of radicals and a terrorist group. In contrast to news stories about similar tragedies, a movie like this shown its power to shock the country. I wish all females will choose their companions more carefully and have a strong opinion about their own religion.

This is more than just a movie; it's a portrayal of ideology in its most basic form that is based on or inspired by the themes of the many happenings in Kerala.

Nursing students molested in a Mall in full public view, in Kerala?? No one reacts, not even mobile phone and online media warriors? Come on.

Nursing students seen taking pills given to them just as if it was the most normal thing to do. Even kids would be wary. Whoever wrote the screenplay needs to get a reality check.

A mother whose daughter is missing for long, gets a surprise call from her later from Afghanistan, and she has for her mushy dialogues, like how does it feel to be a mother.

I saw the Hindi version, for some inexplicable reason all actors speak Hindi with a Malayalam accent and Malyalam with a Hindi accent. You can't be both.

At the end, they say they have filed an RTI to verify their own claims of numbers. It's your own claim! You have to provide proof.

The film is a stark reminder of the harsh realities of extremism, as we witness the devastating impact it has on everyday people. Through the lens of these women, we see the horrors up close, and the emotional toll it takes on them.

But what makes ""The Kerala Story"" so remarkable is the courage and resilience with which the director has approached this subject.

The cinematography is stunning, with each shot perfectly capturing the chaos and destruction. And the film's editing is masterful, creating a sense of tension and urgency that keeps the viewer engaged from start to finish.

All the songs in the film are either used in montage scenes or in the background. There is no waste of time entertainment dance numbers or anything overtly filmi when it comes to the music. The background score is used sparingly but is effective.

Overall: As a film, this is a very tragic subject matter. It's hard to make it through the movie without some sort of emotional reaction, be it sadness, depression or sheer anger. The movie is meant to evoke such reactions. That's what showing the truth as plainly as possible does to the masses. So be warned, this is a film that is hard hitting and not a fun time pass sort of watch. Don't go in with a bunch of friends expecting to have a good time.

Go see it with friends and family to open their eyes on what is going on and what might happen to someone they know and love if we as a society don't hold the people doing such inhuman acts accountable for their actions. This is a film that every Indian needs to see. Its an absolute must watch.

Rating: 7.5/10.

Conclusion: There are no negatives as such in the film, but maybe due to censor board, scenes that are showing the conversion to radical thought process did feel a bit truncated. Some moments of the film could have lingered a tad bit more to hammer the point home. But those are minor gripes in an otherwise well-made film about a very tragic and intense subject matter.",,5 May 2023,8/10

If you are looking for a masala movie then it is not your cup of tea. It is based on a very sensitive topic. It will make you uncomfortable.

The people in India act too sophisticated to not discuss what all is happening in the name of religion. We must make ourselves comfortable and stop fearing that we are judged if we speak the truth about the conversion games.",,6 May 2023,10/10
agrawalvish,"Hello, I have just Watched The Kerela story. What you love is the imotion but if i go with film specific, The movie should be in normal language like more malyalam, but ok, Then second issue is I think very high cuts or Editing issue i don't know but i think some flaws in that, Acting is good, All actors have picked up their character Really well.

Good cinematography, Some points are over the top, Screenplay is very well paced, Good worth of money, Yes the target to particular community is evident, but many things are facts, we can't avoid them, I think in short,

Go have a watch 18+, Good , But hardcore.",,5 May 2023,9/10

limitedwatersupplied,"'The Kerala Story' narrates the tales of three young girls from various regions of Kerala, with the primary focus on the story of Shalini, who is abducted and subsequently converted to Islam. Shalini is then radicalized. And compelled to join ISIS as a terrorist.

'The Kerala Story' is centered around the alleged radicalization and conversion of young Hindu women to Islam in Kerala, after which they are forced to join ISIS. The film states that it's a true story of three young girls from different parts of Kerala.

Riveting story telling method combined with great performances, tight screenplay and crisp editing made it a master piece. What's disturbing is that it's all happened really in the country.

An eye opener for every girls and their families. Must watch.",,5 May 2023,10/10

Very intriguing story, really heart wrenching story, and I could believe it because I had been listening to so called religious people on television word by word, thus all the manipulations presented in this movie are 100 percent correct. I wish that after witnessing this movie, justice would be served, or that at the very least, an investigation would be launched.

A must-see film. The filmmakers of this film performed an excellent job, and I wish them all the success and recognition they deserve.

I am NOT any ideology or party/AGENDA supporter, but I must say this is one of the best movies I have seen in recent times. It shows a very detailed situation of terrorism and it's strategic planning not only in war but in the terms of soft war and brainwashing people. Irrespective of the controversy whether the cases are 32000 or 3, one must understand that even if the case is only ONE still this is what the terrorist have agenda.

Besides the message I must say the acting is done very well by the characters. You will not be bored in the entire duration of the movie. Whether or not you think of this as agenda or truth do watch for the actors and storyline.",,6 May 2023,10/10

It is again propaganda which makes only one religion better than others. Propoganda which casually mocks and makes fun of Hindu's. Also movie shows we are not teaching our kids about our religion, culture and roots and therefore they are not aligning with us instead they aling with others.

ashwinnagar,"The movie Kerala Story is a poignant and thought-provoking portrayal of the dangers and devastation wrought by ISIS terror, particularly in the Indian state of Kerala, which has a large Muslim population. The film sheds light on how ISIS recruits non-Muslim women from Kerala through deceitful means, and then puts them in harm's way on the battlefield, making their lives a living hell. It is a powerful wake-up call for the world to confront the evil designs of this terrorist organization.

Through its gripping narrative and powerful visuals, the movie exposes the insidious tactics used by ISIS to lure young non-Muslim girls, convert them to Islam, and then use them for their own nefarious purposes. The film highlights the stark reality of the situation and makes us aware of the urgent need to act against such heinous acts.

Overall, Kerala Story is a must-watch movie that provides a stark reminder of the dangers posed by terrorism and the need for vigilance against it. It is a powerful call to action for people all over the world to stand up against terrorism and fight for the protection of innocent lives.",,5 May 2023,10/10

Some people have not even watched the movie and calling it against a religion, but there is nothing about any religion in the movie this movie is all about how ISIS Operates and their modus oprandi around the world.

vtmathewm,"I watched the movie after seeing positive reviews.

Sadly disappointed. As a Keralite it was pushing the limits of my intelligence and sense to watch the pathetic screenplay. Nursing students molested in a Mall in full public view, in Kerala?? No one reacts, not even mobile phone and online media warriors? Come on.

Nursing students seen taking pills given to them just as if it was the most normal thing to do. Even kids would be wary. Whoever wrote the screenplay needs to get a reality check.

A mother whose daughter is missing for long, gets a surprise call from her later from Afghanistan, and she has for her mushy dialogues, like how does it feel to be a mother.

I saw the Hindi version, for some inexplicable reason all actors speak Hindi with a Malayalam accent and Malyalam with a Hindi accent. You can't be both.

At the end, they say they have filed an RTI to verify their own claims of numbers. It's your own claim! You have to provide proof.

For me, it's Just a hype created by people.

I don't Care about what others say. The movie is just completely pointless. It feels unnatural.

Its not worth the hype for which people are going Crazy.

The movie claims to be inspired by real-life events, but it seems to be entirely baseless and lacks any real substance. The plot is all over the place, and it's difficult to understand what is happening. The characters are poorly developed, and their motivations are unclear. The dialogues are unconvincing.

Its only the Acting of the Talented Actors which doesn't feel unnatural and feels real.

Despite the movie's claims to be inspired by real-life events, there is no sense of realism or authenticity. The story seems to be fabricated to attract audiences, and the title seems to be a mere marketing ploy. The movie fails to deliver any real emotional impact or make a meaningful statement.

Adah Sharma was able to bring out the emotions and feelings of the audience as it was required from her as an actor. From the South Indian accent to some clap-worthy dialogues, Adah was a treat to watch on the big screen. Sudipto Sen majorly focused on three 'true stories', he did bring out his creative work by not just showing the dark elements but also giving refreshments to his audience by showing the beautiful views of Kerala, a South Indian household, and some college moments. Not only he focused on the plight of the three women but also on the pain that was inflicted on the families. Each woman's story was different from the other but yet connected by the same thread - Terrorism.

Anonymous_ly,"The movie stays to the point for the entire length, the effort to make it in such a way that a typical Indian woman can connect to her daily life, is evident. The parts that appear exaggeratingly violent are unfortunately, factually correct.

The only curse of the movie is that the people have a very rigid perception about the movie, the audience is highly polarized, those who'll watch will support & those who won't will oppose, in all this, the efforts to address an immediate need for a mass level awareness about mainstream beliefs of world's fastest growing religion, are compromised.

One area where it succeeds fully, is in conveying the sorrow of the women portrayed.

Several areas of improvement could be pointed out in terms of subtlety of story & script writing, but they would make the movie irrelevant for the Indian masses.

You dont feel you are watching the movie but a documentary.

Immense research has gone into the movie of 7 years. Director Sudipto Sen has spoken how he visited Kerala several times in past 7yrs to reseach on the subject and that research shows in the film.

pirtaesking,"""The Converted"" appears to be a movie that tackles important and relevant themes related to religious extremism and terrorism. The story of Fatima Ba is likely to be an emotional and thought-provoking journey that sheds light on the power of manipulation and the dangers of religious fanaticism. The film has the potential to spark important discussions about the impact of terrorism on individuals and society, as well as the need to combat extremism in all its forms. However, it is difficult to assess the movie's execution or quality without having seen it. Overall, ""The Converted"" sounds like an important and timely film that has the potential to make a significant impact.

The movie features powerful performances from its ensemble cast, and the direction is skillful in building tension and suspense throughout the narrative. The film is well-researched and presents a controversial topic that raises important questions about politics, power, and human rights. However, some viewers may find the film's portrayal of certain individuals or groups to be biased or one-sided. Overall, ""The Kerala Story(2023)"" is a compelling movie that is sure to leave an impression on its audience.",,5 May 2023,10/10

Movie is a real and authentic portrayal of what was happened in mainland Kerala and happening in north Kerala(Malabar), Dakshin Kannada and Western Tamilnadu region. Spine Chilling and frightening. Any culture/civilization / society which fails to save their women from external predators is doomed to become extinct. Needless to say which culture / civilization and whose ethos are endangered.

krishtealovestealove-81469,"The Kerala Story is a movie that delves into the issue of alleged radicalization and forced conversion of young Hindu women to Islam in Kerala, after which they are coerced into joining ISIS. The movie is based on a true story of three young girls from different parts of Kerala, and the role of Shalini/Fatima is played by Adah Sharma, who delivers a powerful and emotionally stirring performance.

The director Sudipto Sen has chosen a sensitive and complex subject, and the treatment of the film is said to be difficult to watch with several disturbing scenes, moments and dialogues. However, some reviews suggest that the treatment gets increasingly guided more by local politics than cinematic sagacity. While the movie does have some poignant moments, for the most part, it is either the gullible girls eager to buy the propaganda or sly creatures with Muslim names; there is no voice of sanity, and nuance is nowhere to be found.

The movie also features the narration of a converted Muslim woman, Fatima Ba, who shares her story of being abducted from her home and manipulated by religious vanguards to become an ISIS terrorist, eventually landing her in an Afghanistan jail.

The Kerala Story is a movie that highlights a critical issue that is currently affecting many parts of the world, and it is commendable that the director has chosen to bring attention to this subject. The movie attempts to showcase the harrowing experiences of the young girls who are forced to convert and join ISIS, and the emotional toll that this takes on them and their families. Adah Sharma's performance as Shalini/Fatima is powerful, and she brings depth and nuance to her character.

However, as some reviews suggest, the movie could have delved deeper into the issue and provided more nuanced and balanced portrayals of the characters involved. While it is important to raise awareness about the issue of forced conversions and radicalization, it is also important to avoid stereotyping and demonizing entire communities, which can fuel existing biases and prejudices.

Overall, The Kerala Story is a movie that attempts to shine a light on a critical issue, and the performances of the actors, especially Adah Sharma, are noteworthy. However, the treatment of the film could have been more nuanced and balanced to provide a deeper understanding of the complex issues involved. It is a movie worth watching, but with the understanding that it portrays a highly sensitive subject that needs to be examined with care and caution.",,5 May 2023,10/10

nitsvirusboyz,"The Kerala Story is a hard-hitting, shocking, and disturbing film that leaves the viewers with a feeling of discomfort. The story of the film revolves around love-jihad, brutal inhuman crimes such as rape, sex slavery, radicalisation, indoctrination, and ISIS recruitment. Even if the shreds of evidence are lacking, the makers would like you to believe that these events are inspired by true incidents. If you still don't believe that then the victim and the parents of the victims speak at the end of the movie making it more believable.

The director and writers of the film managed to keep the story intriguing. The dialogues are powerful but few are manipulative and it tries to provoke hate. The first half is engaging, fast-paced, and quickly introduces us to three nursing students in Kerala who are brainwashed by an extremist group and makes them believe that only Islam can be their saviour. The screenplay in the second half is engrossing and keeps you hooked until the end of the film. The parallel storylines showing the past and present scenes are well-edited and well-balanced.

Adah Sharma delivers a praiseworthy performance and she has done complete justice to the character of vulnerable Shalini. Her Malayali accent is spot on. Yogita Bihani and Siddhi Idnani played their part very well. Sonia Balani's dialogue delivery and her performance as Asifa was excellent. Other supporting actors played their parts with utmost sincerity.

swaroopnagraj,"The film is an eye-opener. Every Indian should watch this no matter their religion or state. Because this movie shows the truth about Monotheistic Abrahamic religions which only believe in one God and completely reject people belonging to other faiths.

The movie shows the raw stories that happen in countries of the Middle-east, where ISIS and other terror organizations operate. The movie doesn't shy away from depicting blood and gore that is common to desert cultures and people.

People are saying that the makers of the movie lied and that they don't have any proof over the claims of 32,000 women from Kerala being took to Syria. But I would like to ask all of those people, that even if 1 girl has gone through such a blood-curdling experience, isn't this fact itself more than enough to make a movie about the girl's life and why she choose this path.

The purpose of the film is mainly to create awareness and prevent such things from happening in the future and the movie has done an amazing job in this regard. As the message is loud and clear, that anyone who has grand foolish dreams about the ""After-life"" and decides to take the path mentioned in the film, will end up in the same situation as the girl depicted in the movie.

Overall, Sudipto Sen has done an amazing job. The film feels like its almost taken out from a Documentary shot in Syria or Afghanistan. The actors were brilliant especially Adah Sharma, who has done a terrific job and if I may say so, put her ""HEAD"" on the line to make this movie a success. So she deserves all the applause.

Finally, I would like to say that movies are made and released almost every week. But to make a movie like this which shows hardcore facts and throws these facts on the face of those people who are in denial of such obnoxious truths that is happening not only in Kerala, but also in developed countries like US and UK, is praise-worthy and requires some serious balls which Sudipto has proven he has.",,5 May 2023,10/10

moviebluffhere,"Kerala Story must be lauded not because it's an exceptional piece of cinema - or that it subverts some conventions in filmmaking. In fact, on the technical front, it is mediocre at best BUT it is brave attempt to showcase, and perhaps start a conversation about the cultural programming against a community and their religion. It succeeds in capturing the potential of radicalism in Islam, it's dangerous insistence on being non-accepting of other religions, and most importantly it's violent canvassing for the name of ""Allah"" at the cost of subjecting others to absolute cruelty.

It also presents, though a messy, picture of the politics at play. But as was previously mentioned, the movie needs to be lauded because it is unapologetic and thankfully not politically correct. The angst, the contained pain is visible.

Adah Sharma is very convincing in her role, and so are the other two new comers. The music is a little off putting but overall, being an important film it must be watched at least once. Perhaps, it's one of the earlier movies that are going to deal with this subject in a more mature manner. But I'm not going to deduct stars for that.

Acting was ok, nothing spectacular plus the budget was also low due to which the sets and customers looked weak. But overall an good attempt to make a decent movie with just limited production budget.

lakshmishaks88,"""The Kerala Story"" is a compelling and thought-provoking film that sheds light on a subject that has remained untold for far too long. Inspired by true incidents, the movie follows the journey of Shalini Unnikrishnan, played brilliantly by Adah Sharma, as she navigates a dangerous world.

Director Sen employs a shock-and-awe approach, similar to ""The Kashmir Files,"" which adds to the film's compelling nature. The visuals are powerful from the start, with Shalini portrayed as a trapped and manipulated victim. Adah Sharma delivers a bold performance, capturing the essence of her character and bringing attention to the challenges faced by individuals in similar situations.

The plot revolves around Shalini, a student who moves to Kasargod to pursue her studies. There, she encounters three roommates from different backgrounds, setting the stage for intense discussions and exploration of diverse ideologies. These thought-provoking debates raise questions about faith and add depth to the narrative.

As the story unfolds, Shalini faces orchestrated social situations designed to exploit her vulnerability. The film delves into the tactics used by manipulative individuals, shedding light on the methods employed to exert control and influence. Sen provides valuable insight into the complexities of manipulation and radicalization.

Adah Sharma and the supporting cast deliver commendable performances, portraying their characters with authenticity and emotional depth. Their portrayal adds credibility to the narrative, capturing the struggles faced by victims and evoking empathy from the audience.

""The Kerala Story"" also addresses the need for broader conversations about individual freedoms and the protection of human rights. It prompts viewers to reflect on societal norms and the importance of understanding diverse perspectives.

The post-credits scene is particularly moving, as the film includes testimonials from real-life victims' families. This raw and emotional footage serves as a reminder of the real-world impact of extremism and the pain endured by those affected. It leaves a lasting impact on the audience.

While the storyboarding could benefit from further refinement, the filmmakers and crew deserve recognition for their courage in tackling a sensitive subject. By bringing awareness to the struggles faced by victims, they shed light on an important issue that demands attention.

""The Kerala Story"" is a film that should be seen by many, as it brings awareness to the challenges and experiences of victims. It encourages viewers to consider the power of manipulation and serves as a reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding.",,10 May 2023,9/10
sameerlodaya,"Sameer lodaya

The movie emphasised too much on the cross borders of Islamic countries rather than the main content of brain washing and converting to other religion

The content is very tough and is hard to accept the pain of these girls who were influenced to change their minds ,thoughts and religions by a group of separatists

Adah gave a fabulous performance from innocent to militant with good support from other fellow actors

Some scenes were too harsh and were not easy to digest only if you are mentally strong then only go for this movie..the pain has been elongated too much

Some negatives like the pace of the movie is slow in first half..too much of I'll treat was shown on women of other countries which was not required..showing the travel to countries in illegal ways was out of context

nadkarnisumeet,"The Kerala Story review :

Not as hard hitting and engaging as The Kashmir Files (2022), The Kerala Story is still a pertinent take on the religious conversions which we keep hearing in the news. The fact that these Hindu women were not just converted but also instigated to join the ISIS as sex slaves makes for a chilling and compelling watch.

The subtle manner in which the brain washing starts... and where it finally ends is accurately depicted in the movie. The desert locales have an authentic look and the performances from the entire cast, particularly Adah Sharma is first rate. Vipul Amrutlal Shah has touched a daringly realistic subject this time and done fair justice to it though the film has its share of flaws.

The background score jars at times. The Malayalam dialogues with sudden Hindi words in between don't work. And frankly, the easy peasy way in which the two nursing students get convinced by their conniving roommate to change their religion appears a tad too convenient from a writing perspective. The entire brain washing process needed more gravitas..

Having said that, The Kerala Story is a relevant piece of cinema. Such 'love jihad' incidents have indeed taken place and will continue until we have strict enforceable laws in place. This film will at least pose as a warning or a deterrant to the impressionable youngsters falling in to this vicious trap. Recommended stuff!!

anjanashrestha2,"The moment I heard about this movie, I wanted to watch it. I did not have much expectations wrt the direction and the execution of the movie considering the challenging nature of the subject matter. So, I went to watch it ready to accept its subpar performance.

The movie was as expected. The cinematography of the deserts of Afghanistan was very beautiful. The depiction of the people and the culture shown was convincing to me (I haven't done any fact-checking but going with what the movie shows). Credit goes to the individual who conceptualized and captured those locations.

By watching the movie, yes, you understand how the so-called naïve girls are radicalized. However, the radicalization part has been a bit overdone and emphasized a bit more. It lacked the subtleties and the nuances but as I mentioned before, I was expecting that by the look of the trailers. That over-emphasis part can be paralleled with the movie ""3 idiots"" where the characters overplay to explain a point. It looks like the movie makers want to make sure that everyone understood the message loud and clear.

Having said that, the performance from the characters seemed a bit scripted, who otherewise looked talented. I should however commend on Adah Sharma's performance. Given the movies I watched of her (Haseen to Phaseen and Commando 2 or 3), I think this movie gave her a big break. It may even nominate her for the best performance (female) in the movie awards next year. (In fact, the movie itself may earn a couple of nominations.) She may have missed some nuances here and there but that is forgivable, at least to me, given that she still executed the tough role with such determination and courage. Kudos to her!

I am happy that the movie did well. If movies like Pathaan can break the box office, I really think The Kerala Story definitely deserves a chance. It has touched upon such an important issue. Once again, I don't know the facts but given that this is based on a true story, it reflects the ugly truths of the society. It at least makes people think, create an awareness and have them digging for facts. I would any day go and watch and support movies like these than going for Pathaan or like movies. I am not trying to say they are not good or entertaining but I am not drawn to movies that attract people solely by the virtue of big stars, bodies and glamour.

TKS is a movie that is very different and probably the first one in Hindi language (not sure about others) that has been made in the topic. Kudos to the movie makers for making that and for making us think.",,13 May 2023,7/10

sujan854,"The story is good and i think its brave for the director and writer to make a movie about this. But why didn't they try to get better actors for the movie? You can see bad acting from the beginning. The main character Shalini did fine, but those three people taking her interrogation didn't show any expression. They were like reading their lines. This happens for most of the characters. Director should have guided them better. Except for shalini's mother, shalini and her christian friend, none of the actors were even okayish. They were so bad.

Background score made me cringe so many times. Almost every time a muslim girl or any other muslim talks, there is a villain music, even when they are having normal convo. This movie goes too much against muslim.

In the hands of the better moviemaker, this movie could have been great. I don't mind it being controversial because the story is about something that happened in real life. So, there is no problem in subject matter. But the director should go to a film school and hire a better casting director. I still admire him for what he has tried but come on, this is not the way to tell such a serious story.

One more thing, what's up with the subtitles? Can hardly even read them. Even before the dialogue ends, the subtitles of that dialogue goes away. Also, let the scene play out for a while, you don't need to cut it out so quickly.",,20 May 2023,1/10

Simply, a well made movie and good to watch watch in theaters. I had thought, it probably would be a bit cringe worthy to portray it's point but it was'nt.

The movie keeps the audience glued all along and doesn't drag anything. Gets to the point carefully and truthfully. Some scenes can make your eyes wet without over doing on anything. Does remind me of The Kashmir Files and it's careful approach to not get into religious debates and controversies. But the movie making approach is different from TKF. It does opens up the dark truths that have been brushed under the carpet in India but one can relate immediately based on such news that we have read earlier.

Direction is very good, it doesn't let you down and keeps you engaged without one coming out of the zone. It could have been better to Hollywood standards but that's something every Indian movie can be accused of.

Screenplay too is good, its simpler than TKF and mostly linear, keeping Indian audiences in mind. But it does it's job and doesn't drags or make you feel spoon fed at all.

Acting is awesome, every actor has done well in the limited space that they were given. But Adah Sharma steels the show, she amazes you with her acting. She proves, she is totally not a rookie for her debut performance(I guess). Kangana Ranaut would be proud of her acting for sure, that's how good she was.

Makeup and Costume, usually we dont talk about this aspect but makeup and costume work is so good that it simply stands out and gets noticed. Only in few movies you can see this aspect. The initial scene, notice the skin on her face or the condition of her hand, it feels so real. Notice the intricacies in dresses based on location and one scene where she gets ready to flee.

Surprisingly, a couple of background songs are too good, it comes without interrupting the movie and well placed. The lyrics and arrangement are both worth appreciating. The background score is also well in tune with the movie.

This movie also subtly touches issues happening in other parts of the world, indicatively, guess openly would have been better. Some scenes are not good to watch with conservative elders or children but the pain is universal and relatable for everyone.

At the end, there are real testimonies, proving to you that you didn't waste your money and emotion into some false narrative and the issue is real and horrific. Most people were teary eyed at the end, including me. Kudos to the courage of producers to pick this issue, make a film and put the pain of unspoken people in limelight. Hope this movie brings a positive change and no other girl or man gets trapped on something that is draconian to say the least. Do go and watch the movie.",,6 May 2023,10/10

I got goosebumps while the plot advanced through first 20 minutes. I will end by saying that JUST DON'T MISS IT.",,5 May 2023,10/10
mayankkhandiwal,"Movie is really eyeopener and revealing many things. This is a masterpiece everyone should watch. First half take time for addressing characters and building emotions and then it moves around the character and their painful life. Really a good work done by the team.

Screenplay of the movie is well managed and seems like a good researched has been done. If someone is planning to watch the movie he or she should be mentally prepared as the movie reflects many scenes where then pain if the victims is so much painful tha you will feel for them and feel for all those who all are gone with these conditions.",,17 May 2023,10/10
ramyasharmaoct,"Just finished watching Kerala story.. I never felt fear and helplessness the kind I felt it today, I was aware of human trafficking, human slaves and smuggling through news but brainwashing of young girls shattered me to the core.

My mind is still stuck in the character of Nimha the young girl who successfully defended conversation but still couldn't save herself from those predators. Its like once you are at their gun point literally no one can save you, not your family, not even the law of land will protect you.

Thank you for whole team the Kerala story you did a great job of uncovering uncomfortable TRUTH.",,17 May 2023,10/10
caanilverma,"This movie can be treated as entertainment for those who don't want to go in detail of actual activities going on in world as an agenda of a groups thinking.

The film may have shown very simple way the trap being used but it is actually happening, if the girls support to go out of India, they lose their identity and future life. If they don't support to go out then they are killed. This all is happening in name of LOVE JIHAD.

The movie has received both negative and positive comments.

Personally, I liked it more as I am aware of the facts going on in India. And they are surely having funds to distribute so as they can do brainwash and all what is possible to just catch the teenagers in trap.

This movie is surely a good movie.",,8 May 2023,10/10
endodonticsfalguni,Best movie of this year. Shows naked truth and hopefully strict actions will be taken against such community and it's elements to stop destroying the lives of the indian women. Excellent acting and cinematography. It's heart breaking and shocking to know that such conversions are appending in india. Hopefully more movies are made in future so that people come to know the reality. Adah Sharma has acted very well and the movie seems quite disturbing. No wonder it is such a hit in India and the India s are loving it. I did read the real story in one of the reputed news papers in the year of 2021.,,14 May 2023,10/10
kanishka-428-568356,"Given so many reviews are already out - here's a different take! :)

If there is one aspect where this movies seems unprecedented - it is the boldness of the topic and the blunt, yet balanced handling. Its hard to believe such a movie was conceived, produced and tasted such success in a country which used to on the forefront to ban books and any material deemed sensitive to a community!

So does the movie target a community? Not really. The makers have taken a real problem e.g. Radicalisation to convey their point. But what's the real point?

Perhaps, the real point is about one's inherent inability to deal with such meticulously planned devious attacks. If there is one point common in all the protagonists, none of them seem to had any trusted support group. The generation gap causing limited communication with the parents. So the protagonists are like a groups of deers under attack by a pride of lions. A group of confused and ill-prepared teen-adults. And one of the attackers is with them round the clock. Think a bit about it. Its a deadly combination. The targets don't stand much of a chance. And that's where the controversy lies. A full proof plan where the girl leaves for another country and then goes incommunicado. The only way to find the correct no may be to open a hotline and request people to share information. So the actual no is probably never going to come out.

Is the problem still present? If yes, this is perhaps the best thing to do. Spread awareness! And that's what makes it a must watch!",,13 May 2023,10/10
AlphaRomeoKilo,"""Kerala Story"" is a powerful movie that sheds light on the harsh realities of life in Kerala, India. The movie is based on true incidents and depicts the struggles of a young girl who is forced to work as a domestic worker to support her family. The movie showcases the stark differences between the rich and poor in Kerala and the exploitation that takes place in the name of domestic work.

The acting in the movie is outstanding and the cast has done a commendable job in portraying the complex emotions of the characters. The lead actress delivers a standout performance as the young girl who is forced to grow up too quickly and shoulder the burden of her family's financial woes. Her portrayal of the character's struggles and determination is truly inspiring and heart-wrenching.

The hard-hitting facts presented in the movie are eye-opening and shed light on the dark underbelly of Kerala society. The movie shows how the system has failed to protect the rights of the poor and how they are often exploited by the wealthy. The movie also highlights the role of the media and how it can be used to expose injustice and bring about change.

The cinematography and direction of the movie are also worth mentioning. The director has done a brilliant job in bringing the story to life and capturing the beauty of Kerala on camera. The movie's score is also noteworthy, adding to the emotional impact of the story.

Overall, ""Kerala Story"" is a must-watch for anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of the social issues that plague Kerala society. The movie is a powerful reminder that there is still a long way to go in terms of achieving social justice and equality for all. The movie is a testament to the power of cinema in raising awareness and inspiring change.",,9 May 2023,10/10
ronaldosd-73636,"This was painful to watch and extremely painful that thought of those girls who had gone through. The movie is a brilliant enactment of the situation that has befallen the Indian state better known as gods own country. It's a film based on facts and available evidences, and definitely requires a great courage to make. The storytelling and the drama is spot on, the production by Vipul Amrutlal Shah was excellent, cinematography is top notch, music and other technical departments are also well done. Shocked, and speechless after watching.

Overall a must watch film. You may find yourself both whimpering and extremely angry as you watch the second half of the Kerala story.",,7 May 2023,9/10
naimishawasthi,"Was terrified after watching the horrendous and extremely explicit scenes. Movie is not for weak hearted people as it will incite havoc in your mind. One of the career best performances by Adah Sharma playing a sweet innocent yet relentless mentally strong girl.

Brilliant direction by Sudipto Sen for presenting this issue so candidly. A bold and courageous move by filmmakers to bring out such a sensitive and controversial topic. Movie does an excellent job of raising awareness about the dangers of radicalization and how it impacts communities.

You cannot take your eyes off screen even for a second though you'll want to close your senses in some of the scenes.",,9 May 2023,10/10
aanand_ub,"Pace and immersiveness

In the initial 20 minutes or so the performances and story line looked very typical, predictable and plastic. However I did not notice when I lost myself into the plot and storyline. The pace of the movie was quick which could be the reason why the movie could hold interest throughout its running time.

Acting and screen time

The lead role have been been played exceptionally well. The cast selected for different roles were well looking and with easily recognizable facial features and personalities. It was really a tricky task to make multiple ideologies of numerous characters easily identifiable. The plight and condition of parents could have been more. I felt that the amount of screen time and dialogues delivered by parents should have been more, even if that had added 5 more minutes to an already long movie. In reality the parents suffer as much as the children and their voices should have been portrayed more. Overall, every character has played the role well.

Sets and Picturization

The cinematography is just beautiful and breathtaking. At times I wondered if I should celebrate the scenery or lament upon the sensitivity of the situation. It makes me wonder how much detailing was done to make the sets, makeup and costume appear and match so realistically with intended spots. I felt that in few of the introductory scenes rendition of traditional Kerala culture and costumes was stereotypical. But I am not sure if such culture and costume are prominently visible in real life there as I have never visited Kerala. The editing could have been done better if there has not been any kind of censorship or public reaction. It really appears on few occasions that some editing was done under external pressure.

Dialogues and Music

The dialogues were perfectly written and delivered. The music gave goosebumps. The arguments given by one of the leading characters were uncannily similar to the arguments presented by guests and callers in Ex-Muslim streams on youtube. I wonder how the production team found out about the precise rhetoric used in real life for brain washing. The lead role must have practiced hard to get the perfect Hindi accent of Kerala people.

Facts and fiction

The factual and fictional content of the movie can be said to be 50-50. The final mental state of the lead character in the movie and the metal state of real life victims in their video interviews is just the opposite! The sequence of incidents, the way passports are switched from real to fake to avoid tracks of traveling to middle east and the ultimate destiny of victims has been shown correctly. The suffering and torture suffered by sex slaves has been quite diluted. The amount of violence show is heavily diluted as compared to real life footages, but it is still slightly more than what a common person can tolerate.

Coverage of the Issue

The movies covers almost all doctrines of taqiyya, kitman, tawriay, taysir, darura and marura by depicting the techniques of affair, assault, drugs, desertation, extortion, emotional exploitation and above all fear and greed. The methods used by scammers are precise and require training. The points on which I disagree with the movie is that the film shows 100% success rate of these traditional deceptive methods but we know in real life failure do happen and miss rates must be quite high. Some may find the story awkward or not so typical of an interesting movie, but real life is like that. People can be scammed in so many ways that the more you show the worse the story will become. Still, the movie succeeds in covering most of the typical methods with minimum damage to the main story.

Conclusion

Acting, dialoges, narration, picturization, music are good. The way some Hindu religious figures have been ridiculed might offend some Hindus, though nothing serious or offensive has been told or shown about any religion given that it is impossible to separate religion from the underlying phenomena in this kind of scam.",,7 May 2023,10/10

jay-techie2007,"Quite an intense movie. Well made, though it could have been better, especially when comparing it with The Kashmir Files, Kantara or Malikappuram.

But this is a must watch to understand how we, as parents, set up our kids for failure against proselytization when they don't know well enough about our belief system, culture and traditions. In extreme cases, like the one depicted in this movie, they are gobbled up into the world of global terrorism through gradual indoctrination. It shows our blindspots and how, not having kids rooted in our culture, can lead to them getting planted elsewhere.

Good casting with some solid performances. Adah Sharma takes the movie on her shoulders and does a good job of it. The story is well paced - broken into three parts - present, immediate past, and further past - keeping the audience hooked.

bc_raghavendra-604-485763,"Since my native place is near to Mangalore, I know the incidents of the movie are true.

Whereas I am giving only 6 star to this movie because the script should have had more clarity on characters. For example, when the leading character Shalini was taken to SriLanka, she gets a call from her hostel friend who says that they all are trapped. But why didn't Shalini try to escape from SriLanka itself, since she realized about trap? Why did she kept on believing her husband till she reaches Afghanistan?

When Shalini gets cheated by her boy friend, then why did she listen to Maulvi instead of reaching to her mother?

There is no reasons shown in the movie for these.",,23 May 2023,6/10

arvindsamsani,"Keeping politics aside, The Kerala Story has enough potential to become the voice of helpless ISIS brides, but the director messed it up. With such an intense subject, he could have made the movie look more raw and natural. Instead, the director chose to downplay it and made it look like a documentary. The movie has some really good technical values. Camera work was convincing and editing was crisp. There are couple of songs which added some depth to the narrative. But the background score was a let down.

Coming to performances, Adah Sharma nailed it as Shalini. Others were okay and they have given whats needed. Overall, its a pretty decent film but has its flaws.",,6 May 2023,7/10
moviebluffhere,"Kerala Story (2023) must be lauded not because it is an exceptional piece of cinema - or that it subverts some conventions in filmmaking. In fact, on the technical front, it is mediocre at best but it is bold attempt to showcase, and perhaps start a conversation about the cultural programming against a community and their religion. It succeeds in capturing the potential of radicalism in Islam, its dangerous insistence on being non-accepting of other religions, and most importantly its violent canvassing for the name of ""Allah"" at the cost of subjecting others to absolute cruelty.

It also presents, though a messy, picture of the politics at play. But as was previously mentioned, the movie needs to be lauded because it is unapologetic and thankfully not politically correct. The angst, the contained pain is visible.

Adah Sharma is very convincing in her role, and so are the other two new comers. Being an important film it must be watched at least once. Perhaps, it is one of the earlier movies that are going to deal with this subject in a more mature manner. But I am not going to deduct stars for that. I couldn't have expected a masterpiece especially when there is so much of establishment hellbent on stalling the movie's release. It all makes sense why. The movie stirs some questions for sure - and also forces one to think why a movie like this needs to be stopped from releasing when everyone one way or the other is seeing this happen everyday. Perhaps, the filmmaker's lack of political correctness disturbs some.

Also, the movie features some really disturbing sequences of sexual assault and violence. Though the visceral impact is not as intense as The Kashmir Files (2022), it might be traumatising for some viewers.",,7 May 2023,Pas de note

mandarsawant-14413,"The film depicts true story of 3 girls who faced systematic brain washing, love jihad(Different styles), forced and trapped conversion which led to one of them landing in Isis territory as sex slave and currently in Afghanistan Jail, but it extends to thousands and thousands of other cases, missing and/or not reported cases. Once in terrorist territory the victims can never return back, since they are terrorists themselves(having travelled on forged passports/visas and supported in crimes against humanity) and have lost their identity in society.

The story, screenplay, direction and acting has been outstanding. All the actors have played their role wonderfully, particularly the lead role of Nimisha played by Adah Sharma.

engineer_anubhav,"I saw the movie with my entire family. It was a very emotional movie. It is not targeting any religion but it shows the fact about kerala. Overall a good experience. Highly Recommended to all.

The film begins with the interrogation of Shalini/Fatima Ba ( Adah Sharma ) by the Afghanistan authority, who has escaped after being captive in an ISIS hideout for a year.

The film then goes into flashbacks, where she narrates her story of how she ended up in the ISIS base in the Afghanistan-Turkey-Syria border.

The story goes back to when Shalini joined a nursing medical college in a district of Kerala and meet Geetanjali (Siddhi Idnani) and Nimah (Yogita Bihani), and another Muslim classmate Asifa (Sonia Balani), who soon starts her plan to brainwash the three girls and recruit them for ISIS.

Sudipto went raw with his content this time and gave some hard-hitting, and strong dialogue. When Shalini is informed that she can't get her phone back as Sharia law doesn't allow women to keep a phone with themselves, she responds with logic and says, 'Jab Sharia law bana tha, tab phone nahi the', and the narrative follows many such scenes, which left the audience smile and clap in the theatre.

The narrative also shows how the fear of Allah is fed to the girls with scripted attacks, fake love angles, and sexual intimacy with an aim to impregnate the women so that they can be taken to Syria at an ISIS base.

Amid the dark elements and a couple of cruel rape scenes, the makers also a glimpse of the culture and beauty of Kerala.

However, the film is based on half-truths and is based on a few statistics. However, when it comes to hard evidence, we all go empty-handed. It's a good debatable topic but the real truth is what we all want to know. Well, the film will make you all Google the real story. So, Good Luck with that!",,11 May 2023,10/10

purushotamyt,"The Kerala Store movie is a visually stunning and emotionally gripping film. This movie truly delivers an unforgettable cinematic experience. The Kerala Story movie and The Case are two very different works of art with different forms of storytelling. The Kerala Story movie is a visual medium, while The Case is a written work. Although both pieces focus on the culture and traditions of Kerala, they approach the same topic in different ways. I don't know if this story is real, however it was shown to open the eyes of Sanatani's and tells every Sanatani to not withstand all the plotting against us. Since, the old times, we've been plotted against and we're kept away from the truth.",,8 May 2023,10/10

A must watch picture which tells the root cause between a ideology which is just to follow a path way by the medium of fear.

And a also whats internally going on within the nation, the message is very clear in the movie, If you'll be united and educated you'll surely be sustained otherwise ruthlessly you'll be killed.

The casting the acting the screenplay, music everything is top notch.

The direction and the proof given about the incident on the end of the movie justifying the reality of the rigid mindset.

Same is the case with this movie THE KERALA STORY. Again not much promotion from the team of makers but this masterpiece will gather hearings from its own.

These type of movies have 2 big factors to dictate their fortunes - One is the concept on which they are based and other is the Cast and their acting skills.

In short . Once in a lifetime movie... Don't miss it... Superb concept & owsm acting by Adah Sharma.. go & watch in theatres only.

This is a movie which is difficult to watch. Not because it is not well made, but because it shows the stark-naked truth in such a simple and devastating manner. Things that happen to the women in this film which is based on real life incidents are not for the weak of stomach. But it's the reality we live in and most would find it convenient to ignore the truth rather than confront it.

As a film, the cinematography is good, the camera work is organic and not overly dramatic. There are some dramatic shots, but those are needed to set the tone of the film. The look and feel of the film seem more real than fictional.

A must watch and a film which requires much discussion with every scene serving as an initial point for seeking and learning in depth of what ideology and doctrine it represents. The Kerala Story (2023) shows every aspect which was intentionally/unintentionally missed out by the hit TV Series from Sweden, Caliphate (2020), also clearly mentioning the Bhartiya (Indian) context and how certain ideologies threaten the peace and prosperity of unity in diversity of which Bharat is a prime example prior to the advent of Abrahamic religions' invasive and destructive coloniality.",,16 May 2023,10/10

This engrossing and provocative movie explores the complex realm of political appeasement and reveals the unseen realities that lurk under the surface. It courageously addresses a subject that is frequently disregarded or omitted, illuminating the repercussions and difficulties of surrendering beliefs for the sake of political success.

Although I was aware of the events in Kerala, this film did a remarkable job of telling the story of Nimisha and her friends. This film does not criticise any one religion; instead, it merely depicts the actions of a small number of radicals and a terrorist group. In contrast to news stories about similar tragedies, a movie like this shown its power to shock the country. I wish all females will choose their companions more carefully and have a strong opinion about their own religion.

This is more than just a movie; it's a portrayal of ideology in its most basic form that is based on or inspired by the themes of the many happenings in Kerala.

Change of thought process, change of perspective etc. This is a movie that changes your perception of the world we live in, especially if you don't know what sort of things are happening around us hidden in plain sight.

This is a movie which is difficult to watch. Not because it is not well made, but because it shows the stark-naked truth in such a simple and devastating manner. Things that happen to the women in this film which is based on real life incidents are not for the weak of stomach.

The narrative of the film is nonlinear. It follows roughly three different timelines of the same person. First one of her being in college, another of her in Afghanistan and the last one of her incarcerated at an UN detention camp. The scenes flow mostly seamlessly from one timeline to the other. Sometimes the shift in tonality from a happy and positive interaction in the past to a rather bleak and grim present is done intentionally to jar the audience and shake them from their slumber (figuratively speaking) of believing all is right in the world just because they can't see such things happening in front of them.",,22 May 2023,9/10

Visually, the film is a treat for the eyes. The cinematography is skillfully executed, utilizing a combination of striking visuals and atmospheric lighting to create a mood that complements the narrative.

The script is largely well written, and the performances overall were exceptional. Yes it was a touch contrived at times, but the truth can be contrived ! It doesnt make it any less important.

shriramguptaji,"I recently watched ""The Kerala Story,"" and I wanted to share my thoughts with you. It's a thought-provoking film that tackles the sensitive issue of ISIS recruitment from Kerala. I must say, it was quite courageous of the filmmakers to delve into such a controversial topic.

The movie does an excellent job of raising awareness about the dangers of radicalization and how it impacts communities. It sheds light on the methods used by extremist groups to manipulate vulnerable individuals, and it humanizes the victims, showing the struggles faced by families and communities affected by radicalization.

What's impressive is that ""The Kerala Story"" manages to maintain a balanced approach. It not only highlights the issue of ISIS recruitment but also portrays the cultural heritage and traditions of Kerala. By doing so, it creates a stark contrast between the beauty of the region's cultural tapestry and the unfortunate reality of extremist influences.

I appreciated that the film didn't glorify or sensationalize the topic. Instead, it offers a critical examination of the socio-political factors that contribute to vulnerabilities. It prompts important discussions and helps us understand the underlying reasons behind such issues.

The direction, screenplay, and performances in the movie are top-notch. Despite the seriousness of the subject matter, the narrative remains engaging, keeping you invested in the characters and their journeys. The cast delivers powerful and nuanced performances, effectively portraying the emotional turmoil and dilemmas faced by those affected by radicalization.

nehrotramahi,"This movie gives a reality check to all of us. All this is not even 1% of what happens in reality. I thoroughly support this movie. It is a must watch. Great movie. Great topic.

This will help a lot of girls in near future from these kind of crimes and happenings.

I think we all should support these kind of movies, which would educated people through true stories of people who have faced it.

The actors truly nailed their roles especially Adah Sharma as Shalini Unnikrishnan and then as Fatima Ba .

The audience was rotted at their places when the movie ended, everyone was too numb and many had tears in their eyes, including me.

This is a real story and people should definitely support it. Best Movie of the year.",,13 May 2023,10/10

shaswatadhikari,This movie will open your eyes regarding protraying the harsh truth about the love jihad. This movie should be free for all adult girls above 18 because movie is a very strong way to represent how terrorism can use fake love as a tool to influence small and middle class girls. This has a strong message how wrong people can mess up with their life. Story has a very strong message and it should be a awareness for all girls out there who are in blind trust. As responsible citizen of india I recommend all young girls to watch this movie so that this should never be happen again with any other girl. Thanks.,,4 June 2023,10/10
